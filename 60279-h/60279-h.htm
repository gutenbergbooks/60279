<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e185"><span class="xd29e185init">T</span>he story of Pele and her sister Hiiaka stands at the fountain-head of Hawaiian myth
and is the matrix from which the unwritten literature of Hawaii drew its life-blood.
The material for the elaboration of this story has, in part, been found in serial
contributions to the Hawaiian newspapers during the last few decades; in part, gathered
by interviews with the men and women of the older regime, in whose memory it has been
stored and, again, in part, it has been supplied by papers solicited from intelligent
Hawaiians. The information contained in the notes has been extracted by <i>viva voce</i> appeal to Hawaiians themselves. These last two sources of information will soon be
no longer available.
</p>
<p>Merely as a story, this myth of Pele and her kindred may be deemed to have no compelling
merit that should attract one to its reading. The cycle of world-myth already gathered
from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north pole to the south pole,
is quite vast enough, and far in excess of the power of any one scholar to master
and digest. It contains enough pretty stories, in all conscience, to satisfy the demands
of the whole raft of storiologists and penny-a-liners, ever on the alert to cram the
public with new sensations, without making it necessary to levy upon Hawaii for her
little contribution.
</p>
<p>It is not from a disposition to pander to any such appetite that the writer has drudged
through many long years in collecting and giving literary shape to the material herein
presented. The people who settled the Hawaiian group of islands are recognized as
having occupied a unique station, one so far removed from the center and vortex of
Polynesian activity as to enable them to cast a highly important side-light on many
of the problems yet unsolved, that are of interest to ethnologists and philologists
and that still enshroud the Polynesian race.
</p>
<p>Hawaii rejoiced in a Kamehameha, who, with a strong hand, welded its discordant political
elements into one body and made of it a nation. But it was denied a Homer capable
of voicing its greatest epic in one song. The myth of the volcanic queen, like every
other important Hawaiian myth, has been handled by many poets and raconteurs, each
from his own point of view, influenced, no doubt, by local environment; but there
never stood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e193" href="#xd29e193">VI</a>]</span>forth one singer with the supreme power to symphonize the jarring notes and combine
them into one concordant whole. This fact is a tribute to the independent attitude
of Hawaii&#x2019;s geographical units as well as to its scattered minstrelsy.
</p>
<p>This book does not offer itself as a complete history of Pele; it does not even assume
to present all the oli, mele, and pule that deal with the great name of Pele. There
were important events in her life that will receive but incidental mention. Of such
is the story of Pele&#x2019;s relations with the swine-god Kama-pua&#x2019;a. As indicated in the
title, the author confines his attention almost wholly to the story of Pele&#x2019;s relations
with Prince Lohiau of Haena, in which the girl Hiiaka became involved as an accessory.
</p>
<p>It was inevitable that such a myth as that of Pele should draw to it and, like an
ocean-reef, become the stranding ground of a great mass of flotsam and jetsam poetry
and story. Especially was this true of those passional fragments of Hawaiian mele
and oli, which, without this, would not easily have found a concrete object to which
they might attach themselves.
</p>
<p>It matters not whether the poet-philosopher, deep pondering on the hot things of love,
hit upon Pele as the most striking and appropriate character to serve his purpose
and to wear his garment of passionate song and story, or, whether his mind, working
more objectively, took Nature&#x2019;s suggestion and came to realize that, in the wild play
of the volcanic forces, he had exemplified before him a mighty parable of tempestuous
love. Certain it is that the volcano was antecedent to the poet and his musings, and
it seems more reasonable to suppose that from it came the first suggestion and that
his mind, as by a flash of inspiration, began its subjective work as the result of
what he saw going on before his eyes.
</p>
<p>The Hawaiian to whose memory was committed the keeping of an old time mele regarded
it as a sacred trust, to be transmitted in its integrity; and he was inclined to look
upon every different and contradictory version of that mele as, in a sense, an infringement
of his preserve, a desecration of that sacred thing which had been entrusted to him.
It resulted from this that such a thing as a company of haku-mele (poets or song-makers)
conferring together for the purpose of settling upon one authoritative version of
a historic mele was an impossibility.
</p>
<p>It is a misfortune when the myth-cycle of any people or country is invaded for exploitation
by that class of writers whose sole object is to pander, or cater&#x2014;to use a softer
term&#x2014;to the public <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e201" href="#xd29e201">VII</a>]</span>taste for novelty and sensation, before that cycle has been canvassed and reported
upon by students who approach it in a truthful yet sympathetic spirit. In other words:
plain exposition should come before sensational exploitation. To reverse the order
would be as undesirable as to have Münchausen gain the ear of the public before Mungo
Park, Livingston, Stanley, Cook, or Vancouver had blazed the way and taken their observations.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for Hawaii, the spirit of the times has set its face like a flint against
this sort of sensation-mongering, and if a Münchausen were now to claim the public
ear he would have the searchlight of scientific investigation turned upon him as pitilessly
as it was done in the case of an alleged claim to the discovery of the north pole.
</p>
<p>It is a satisfaction to the author, after having accomplished his pioneer work of
opening up a new domain, to bid the public enter in and enjoy the delicious lehua
parks once claimed by the girl Hiiaka as her own; and he can assure them that there
yet remain many coverts that are full of charm which are to this day unravaged by
the fires of Pele.
</p>
<p>Thanks, many thanks, are due from the author&#x2014;and from us all&#x2014;to the men and women
of Hawaiian birth whose tenacious memories have served as the custodians of the material
herein set forth, but who have ungrudgingly made us welcome to these remainder biscuits
of mythological song and story, which, but for them, would have been swallowed up
in the grave, unvoiced and unrecorded.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd29e212"><span class="xd29e212init">A</span>ccording to Hawaiian myth, Pele, the volcanic fire-queen and the chief architect of
the Hawaiian group, was a foreigner, born in the mystical land of Kuai-he-lani, a
land not rooted and anchored to one spot, but that floated free like the Fata Morgana,
and that showed itself at times to the eyes of mystics, poets and seers, a garden
land, clad with the living glory of trees and habitations&#x2014;a vision to warm the imagination.
The region was known as Kahiki (Kukulu o Kahiki), a name that connotes Java and that
is associated with the Asiatic cradle of the Polynesian race.
</p>
<p>Pele&#x2019;s mother was Haumea, a name that crops up as an ancestor in the hoary antiquity
of the Hawaiian people, and she was reputed to be the daughter of Kane-hoa-lani.
</p>
<p>Pele was ambitious from childhood and from the earliest age made it her practice to
stick close to her mother&#x2019;s fireplace in company with the fire-keeper Lono-makua,
ever watchful of his actions, studious of his methods&#x2014;an apprenticeship well fitted
to serve her in good stead such time as she was to become Hawaii&#x2019;s volcanic fire-queen.
This conduct drew upon Pele the suspicion and illwill of her elder sister Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#x2019;i,
a sea-goddess, who, fathoming the latent ambition of Pele, could not fail to perceive
that its attainment would result in great commotion and disturbance in their home-land.
</p>
<p>Her fears and prognostications proved true. Namaka, returning from one of her expeditions
across the sea, found that Pele, taking advantage of her absence, had erupted a fiery
deluge and smothered a portion of the home-land with aä.
</p>
<p>It would have gone hard with Pele; but mother Haumea bade her take refuge in the fold
(<i lang="haw">pola</i>) of Ka-moho-alii&#x2019;s malo. Now this elder brother of Pele was a deity of great power
and authority, a terrible character, hedged about with tabus that restricted and made
difficult the approach of his enemies. Such a refuge could only be temporary, and
safety was to be assured only by Pele&#x2019;s removal from her home in the South land, and
that meant flight. It was accomplished in the famed mythical canoe Honua-i-a-kea.
</p>
<p>The company was a distinguished one, including such godlike beings as Ka-moho-alii,
Kane-apua, Kane-milo-hai and many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e224" href="#xd29e224">X</a>]</span>other relations of Pele, the youngest, but not the least important, of whom was the
girl Hiiaka, destined to be the heroine of the story here unfolded and of whom it
was said that she was born into the world as a clot of blood out of the posterior
fontanelle (<i lang="haw">nunoi</i>) of her mother Haumea, the other sisters having been delivered through the natural
passage.
</p>
<p>The sailing course taken by Pele&#x2019;s company brought them to some point northwest of
Hawaii, along that line of islets, reefs, and shoals which tail off from Hawaii as
does the train of a comet from its nucleus. At Moku-papápa Pele located her brother
Kane-milo-hai, as if to hold the place for her or to build it up into fitness for
human residence, for it was little more than a reef. Her next stop was at the little
rock of Nihoa that lifts its head some eight hundred feet above the ocean. Here she
made trial with the divining rod Paoa, but the result being unfavorable, she passed
on to the insignificant islet of Lehua which clings like a limpet to the flank of
Niihau. In spite of its smallness and unfitness for residence, Pele was moved to crown
the rock with a wreath of kau-no&#x2019;a, while Hiiaka contributed a chaplet of lehua which
she took from her own neck, thus christening it for all time. The poet details the
itinerary of the voyage in the following graphic lines:

</div>
<p class="first">Repeated trial with the divining rod, Paoa, made on the western part of Maui as well
as on the adjoining islands of Molokai and Lanai proving unsatisfactory, Pele moved
on to the exploration of the noble form of Hale-a-ka-la that domes East Maui, with
fine hope and promise of success. But here again she was dissatisfied with the result.
She had not yet delivered herself from the necessity of protection by her kinsman,
Ka-moho-alii: &#x201c;One girdle yet serves for you and for me,&#x201d; was the note that still
rang out as a confession of dependence, in her song.
</p>
<p>While Pele was engaged in her operations in the crater of Hale-a-ka-la, her inveterate
enemy Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#x2019;i, who had trailed her all the way from Kahiki with the persistency
of a sea-wolf, appeared in the offing, accompanied by a sea-dragon named Ha-ui.
</p>
<p>The story relates that, as Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#x2019;i passed the sand-spit of Moku-papápa,
Kane-milo-hai, who, it will be remembered, had been left there in charge as the agent
of Pele, hailed her with the question: &#x201c;Where are you going so fast?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;To destroy my enemy, to destroy Pele,&#x201d; was her answer.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Return to Kahiki, lest you yourself be destroyed,&#x201d; was the advice of Kane-milo-hai.
</p>
<p>Pele, accepting the gage thrown down by <span class="corr" id="xd29e419" title="Source: Na-maka-o-kaha&#x2019;i">Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#x2019;i</span>, with the reluctant consent of her guardian Ka-moho-alii, went into battle single-handed.
The contest was terrific. The sea-monster, aided by her dragon consort, was seemingly
victorious. Dismembered parts of Pele&#x2019;s body were cast up at Kahiki-nui, where they
are still pointed out as the bones of Pele (<i lang="haw">na iwi o Pele</i>.) (She was only bruised). Ka-moho-alii was dismayed thinking Pele to have been destroyed;&#x2014;but,
looking across the Ale-nui-haha channel, he saw the spirit-form of Pele flaming in
the heavens above the summits of Mauna-loa and Mauna-kea. As for Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#x2019;i,
she retired from the battle exultant, thinking that her enemy Pele was done for: but
when she reported her victory to Kane-milo-hai, that friend of Pele pointed to the
spirit body of Pele glowing in the heavens as proof that she was mistaken. Namaka
was enraged at the sight and would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd29e425" href="#xd29e425">XV</a>]</span>have turned back to renew the conflict, but Kane-milo-hai dissuaded her from this
foolhardy undertaking, saying, &#x201c;She is invincible; she has become a spirit.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The search for a home-site still went on. Even Hale-a-ka-la was not found to be acceptable
to Pele&#x2019;s fastidious taste. According to one account it proved to be so large that
Pele found herself unable to keep it warm. Pele, a goddess now, accordingly bade adieu
to Maui and its clustering isles and moved on to Hawaii.

rose and used the Paoa staff. The omens were favorable, and Pele decided that this
was the place for her to establish a permanent home.
</p>
<p>The people immediately began to set out many plants valuable for food; among them
a variety of kalo called aweü, well suited for upland growth; the ulu (<i>bread-fruit</i>); the maiä (banana); the pala-á (an edible fern); the awa (<i lang="la">Piper methysticum</i>) and other useful plants.
</p>
<p>The land on the Hilo side of Kilauea, being in the rain belt, is fertile and well
fitted for tillage. The statement, however, that Kilauea, or its vicinity, became
the place of settlement for any considerable number of people cannot be taken literally.
The climatic conditions about Kilauea are too harsh and untropical to allow either
the people or the food plants of Polynesia to feel at home in it. The probability
is that instead of being gathered about Kilauea, they made their homes in the fat
lands of lower Puna or Hilo.
</p>
<p>Pele, on her human side at least, was dependent for support and physical comfort upon
the fruits of the earth and the climatic conditions that made up her environment.
Yet with all this, in the narrative that follows her relations to humanity are of
that exceptional character that straddle, as it were, that border line which separates
the human from the superhuman, but for the most part occupy the region to the other
side of that line, the region into which if men and women of this work-a-day world
pass they find themselves uncertain whether the beings with whom they converse are
bodied like themselves or made up of some insubstantial essence and liable to dissolve
and vanish at the touch.

<h2 class="main">PELE IN THE BOSOM OF HER FAMILY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once, when Pele was living in the pit of Kilauea, she roused up from her couch on
the rough hearth-plate and said to her sisters, &#x201c;Let us make an excursion to the ocean
and enjoy ourselves, open the opihi shells and sea-urchins, hunt for small squid and
gather sea-moss.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>To this all joyfully assented, saying, &#x201c;Yes, let us go.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The sisters formed quite a procession as they tramped the narrow downhill path until
they came to the hill Pu&#x2019;u-Pahoehoe&#x2014;a place in the lower lands of Puna. Pele herself
did not visibly accompany them on this journey; that was not according to her custom:
she had other ways and means of travel than to plod along a dusty road. When, however,
the party arrived at the rendezvous, there, sure enough, they found Pele awaiting
them, ready for the business in hand.
</p>
<p>In the midst of their pleasurings Pele caught sight of Hopoe and Haena as they were
indulging in an <i>al fresco</i> dance and having a good time by the Puna sea. She was greatly pleased and, turning
to her sisters, said, &#x201c;Come, haven&#x2019;t you also got some dance that you can show off
in return for this entertainment by Hopoe and her companion?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>They all hung their heads and said, &#x201c;We have no hula.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, the youngest, had stayed behind to gather lehua flowers, and when she came
along laden with wreaths, Pele said to her, jestingly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just been proposing to
your sisters here to dance a hula in response to that of Hopoe and her fellow, but
they decline, saying they have not the art. I suppose it&#x2019;s of no use to ask you, you
are so small; but, perhaps, you&#x2019;ve got a bit of a song.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes, I have a song,&#x201d; Hiiaka answered, to the surprise of all.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Let us have it, then; go on!&#x201d; said Pele.
</p>
<p>Then the little girl, having first decorated all of her sisters with the wreaths,
beginning with Pele, sang as follows:
</p>

<p>Hiiaka put even more spirit into the song as she complied:

</div>
<p class="first">At the conclusion of this innocent performance&#x2014;the earliest mention of the hula that
has reached us&#x2014;Hiiaka went to stay with her friend Hopoe, a person whose charm of
character had fascinated the imagination of the susceptible girl and who had already
become her dearest intimate, her inspiring mentor in those sister arts, song, poesy
and the dance.
</p>
<p>Pele herself remained with her sister Hiiaka-i-ka-pua-enaena (Hiiaka-of-the-fire-bloom),
and presently she lay down to sleep <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>in a cave on a smooth plate of pahoehoe. Before she slept she gave her sister this
command: &#x201c;Listen to me. I am lying down to sleep; when the others return from fishing,
eat of the fish, but don&#x2019;t dare to wake me. Let me sleep on until I wake of myself.
If one of you wakes me it will be the death of you all. If you must needs wake me,
however, call my little sister and let her be the one to rouse me; or, if not her,
let it be my brother Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua&#x2014;one of these two.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>When Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua, who was so closely related to Pele that she called him
brother, had received this command and had seen her lapse into profound sleep he went
and reported the matter to Hiiaka, retailing all that Pele had said. &#x201c;Strange that
this havoc-producer should sleep in this way, and no bed-fellow!&#x201d; said Hiiaka to herself.
&#x201c;Here are all the other Hiiakas, all of equal rank and merit! Perhaps it was because
my dancing pleased her that she wishes me to be the one to rouse her.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The cavern in the hill Pahoehoe in which Pele lay and slept, wrapped in her robe (<i lang="haw">kapa-ahu</i>), remains to this day.
</p>
<p>In her sleep Pele heard the far-off beating of hula drums, and her spirit-body pursued
the sound. At first it seemed to come from some point far out to sea; but as she followed,
it shifted, moving to the north, till it seemed to be off the beach of Waiakea, in
Hilo; thence it moved till it was opposite Lau-pahoehoe. Still evading her pursuit,
the sound retreated till it came from the boisterous ocean that beats against the
shaggy cliffs of Hamakua. Still going north, it seemed presently to have reached the
mid channel of Ale-nui-haha that tosses between Hawaii and Maui.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;If you are from my far-off home-land Kahiki, I will follow you thither, but I will
come up with you,&#x201d; said Pele.
</p>
<p>To her detective ear, as she flitted across the heaving waters of Ale-nui-haha, the
pulsing of the drums now located itself at the famous hill Kauwiki, in Hana; but,
on reaching that place, the music had passed on to the west and sounded from the cliffs
of Ka-haku-loa.
</p>
<p>The fugitive music led her next across another channel, until in her flight she had
traversed the length of Moloka&#x2019;i and had come to the western point of that island,
Lae-o-ka-laau. Thence she flew to cape Maka-pu&#x2019;u, on Oahu, and so on, until, after
crossing that island, she reached cape Kaena, whose finger-point reaches out towards
Kaua&#x2019;i. In that desolate spot dwelt an aged creature of myth, Pohaku-o-Kaua&#x2019;i by name,
the personal representative of that rock whose body-form the hero Mawi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>had jerked from its ocean bed ages before, in his futile attempt to draw together
the two islands Kaua&#x2019;i and Oahu and unite them into one mass.
</p>
<p>Pele, arguing from her exasperation, said, &#x201c;It must be my old grandfather Pohaku-o-Kaua&#x2019;i
who is playing this trick with the music. If it&#x2019;s he that&#x2019;s leading me this chase,
I&#x2019;ll kill him.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The old fellow saw her approach and, hailing her from a distance, greeted her most
heartily. Her answer was in a surly mood: &#x201c;Come here! I&#x2019;m going to kill you to-day.
So it&#x2019;s you that&#x2019;s been fooling me with deceitful music, leading me a wearisome chase.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Not I, I&#x2019;ve not done this. There they are, out to sea; you can hear for yourself.&#x201d;
And, sure enough, on listening, one could hear the throbbing of the music in the offing.
</p>
<p>Pele acknowledged her mistake and continued her pursuit, with the parting assurance
to the old soul that if he <i>had</i> been the guilty one, it would have been his last day of life.
</p>
<p>The real authors of this illusive musical performance were two little creatures named
Kani-ka-wí and Kani-ka-wá, the former a sprite that was embodied in the nose-flute,
the latter in the hokeo, a kind of whistle, both of them used as accompaniments to
the hula. Their sly purpose was to lure Pele to a place where the hula was being performed.
</p>
<p>Pele now plunged into the water&#x2014;from this point at least she swam&#x2014;and, guided by the
call of the music, directed her course to the little village of Haena that perched
like a gull on the cape of the same name, at the northernmost point of the island
of Kaua&#x2019;i. It was but a few steps to the hall of the hula&#x2014;the <i lang="haw">halau</i>&#x2014;where throbbed the hula drums and where was a concourse of people gathered from the
whole island.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">PELE MEETS AND FASCINATES LOHIAU</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As Pele drew near to the rustic hall where the hula was in full blast, the people
in the outskirts of the assembly turned to look in wonder and admiration at the beauty
and charm of the stranger who had appeared so unexpectedly and whose person exhaled
such a fragrance, as if she had been clad with sweet-scented garlands of maile, lehua
and hala. One and all declared her to be the most beautiful woman they had ever looked
upon. Where was she from? Surely not from Kaua&#x2019;i. Such loveliness could not have remained
hidden in any nook or corner of the island, they declared.
</p>
<p>Instinctively the wondering multitude parted and offered a lane for her to pass through
and enter the halau, thus granting to Pele a full view of the musicians and performers
of the hula, and, sitting in their midst, Lohiau,&#x2014;as yet seemingly unconscious of
her presence,&#x2014;on his either hand a fellow drummer; while, flanking these to right
and left, sat players with a joint of bamboo in either hand (the kaekeeke). But drummer
and kaekeeke-player, musicians and actors&#x2014;aye, the whole audience&#x2014;became petrified
and silent at the sight of Pele, as she advanced step by step, her eyes fixed on Lohiau.
</p>
<p>Then, with intensified look, as if summoning to her aid the godlike gifts that were
hers as the mistress of Kilauea, she reached out her hand and, in a clear tone, with
a mastery that held the listeners spell-bound, she chanted:
</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The silence became oppressive. In the stillness that followed the song expectant eyes
were focused upon Prince Lohiau, awaiting his reply to the address of the stranger
who stood in their midst. No one knew who she was; no one imagined her to be Pele.
That she was a person of distinction and rank was evident enough, one whom it was
the duty and rare privilege of their chief to receive and entertain.
</p>
<p>Presently there was wrinkling of foreheads, an exchange of glances, prompting winks
and nods, inclinations of the head, a turning of the eyes&#x2014;though not a word was spoken&#x2014;;
for his friends thought thus to rouse Lohiau from his daze and to prompt him to the
dutiful rites of hospitality and gallantry. Paoa, his intimate friend, sitting at
Lohiau&#x2019;s right hand, with a drum between his knees, even ventured to nudge him in
the side.

<p class="first">Lohiau, once roused from his ecstacy, rose to the occasion and with the utmost gallantry
and politeness invited Pele to sit with him and partake of the hospitalities of the
halau.
</p>
<p>When Pele had seated herself on the mat-piled dais, Lohiau, following the etiquette
of the country, asked whence she came.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I am of Kaua&#x2019;i,&#x201d; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;There is no woman of Kaua&#x2019;i your equal in beauty,&#x201d; said Lohiau. &#x201c;I am the chief and
I know, for I visit every part of the whole island.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You have doubtless traveled about the whole island,&#x201d; answered Pele; &#x201c;yet there remain
places you are not acquainted with; and that is where I come from.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;No, no! you are not of Kaua&#x2019;i. Where <i>are</i> you from?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Because of his importunity, Pele answered him, &#x201c;I am from Puna, from the land of the
sunrise; from Ha&#x2019;eha&#x2019;e, the eastern gate of the sun.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Lohiau bade that they spread the tables for a feast, and he invited Pele to sit with
him and partake of the food. But Pele refused food, saying, &#x201c;I have eaten.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;How can that be?&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;seeing you have but now come from a long journey? You
had better sit down and eat.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Pele sat with him, but she persistently declined all his offers of food, &#x201c;I am not
hungry.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Lohiau sat at the feast, but he could not eat; his mind was disturbed; his eyes were
upon the woman at his side. When they rose from the table he led her, not unwilling,
to his house, and he lay down upon a couch by her side. But she would favor him only
with kisses. In his growing passion for her he forgot his need of food, his fondness
for the hula, the obligations that rested upon him as a host: all these were driven
from his head.
</p>
<p>All that night and the following day, and another night, and for three days and three
nights, he lay at her side, struggling with her, striving to overcome her resistance.
But she would grant him only kisses.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>And, on the third night, as it came towards morning, Pele said to Lohiau, &#x201c;I am about
to return to my place, to Puna, the land of the sunrise. You shall stay here. I will
prepare a habitation for us, and, when all is ready I will send and fetch you to myself.
If it is a man who comes, you must not go with him; but, if a woman, you are to go
with the woman. Then, for five days and five nights you and I will take our fill of
pleasure. After that you will be free to go with another woman.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In his madness, Lohiau put forth his best efforts to overcome Pele&#x2019;s resistance, but
she would not permit him. &#x201c;When we meet on Hawaii you shall enjoy me to your fill,&#x201d;
said she. He struggled with her, but she foiled him and bit him in the hand to the
quick; and he grasped the wound with the other hand to staunch the pain. And he, in
turn, in the fierceness of his passion, planted his teeth in her body.
</p>
<p>At this, Pele fluttered forth from the house, plunged into the ocean and&#x2014;was gone.

<p class="first">When Lohiau came to himself, as from a dream, he looked for the woman who had lain
at his side, but her place was vacant and cold. He went out into the open air, but
she was nowhere to be found, and he turned back into the empty house.
</p>
<p>Lohiau&#x2019;s stay with Pele in the sleeping house had prolonged itself beyond all reason
and his friends became concerned about him; and as night after night and day after
day passed and they neither saw nor heard anything of him, their concern grew into
alarm. Yet no one dared enter the house. Lohiau&#x2019;s sister, however, made it her business
to investigate. Opening the door of the house, she entered, and, lo, there hung the
body of her brother, suspended from a rafter, his malo about his neck. Life had been
gone for many hours and the body was cold. Her screams brought to her aid a group
of Lohiau&#x2019;s friends who at once lifted their voices in unison with hers, bewailing
their chief&#x2019;s death and denouncing the woman who had been with him as the guilty cause.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paoa was the most outspoken in his imprecations. Stripping off his malo, he stood
forth in the garb of nature and declared he would not resume his loin cloth until
he had sought out the woman and humiliated her by the grossest of insults. &#x201c;I will
not gird my loins with a malo until I have kindled a fire in Pele&#x2019;s face, pounded
her face as one pounds a taro, consumed her very eyes.&#x201d; This was the savage oath with
which Paoa pledged his determination to avenge the death of his friend, his chief,
Lohiau. With universal wailing, amid the waving of kahilis, with tender care and the
observance of all due rites, his people anointed the dear body of their chief with
perfumed oil, wrapped it in scented robes of choicest tapa, and laid it to rest in
the sepulcher.
</p>
<p>The favorite dog of Lohiau, who was greatly attached to his master, took his station
at the grave and would not be persuaded to leave. Poha-kau, a cousin of Pele,&#x2014;himself
a kupua and possessed of superhuman powers,&#x2014;having journeyed from Hawaii to Haena,
found the faithful creature keeping his lonely vigil at the grave and he brought the
dog with him to Pele.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Your man is dead; Lohiau is dead,&#x201d; said he. &#x201c;But this animal&#x2014;do you recognize him?&#x2014;I
found watching by the grave in Haena.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes, that is the dog I saw with Lohiau,&#x201d; answered Pele; and she hid the dog away
in her secret place.

<h2 class="main">PELE AWAKES FROM HER SLEEP</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the scene we have described was being enacted on Kaua&#x2019;i, the spirit of Pele,
returning from its long flight, hovered over the sleeping body at Lau-pahoehoe. Above
it waved the kahilis, about it were gathered the sisters and other relatives, quietly
sobbing. Though it was many days since Pele had lain down to sleep, and though they
feared the consequences if she continued thus, they dared not disturb her. When that
was proposed, the sister in charge objected. &#x201c;If it must be done, we shall have to
send for Hiiaka the beloved.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Some of them suggested that Pele must be dead, she had remained so long without motion.
But Hiiaka-of-the-lightning-flash scouted the idea: &#x201c;How can that be? The body shows
no signs of decay.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>The girl Hiiaka saw the messenger that had been despatched to fetch her, while as
yet she was in the dim distance,&#x2014;it was her nurse, Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e,&#x2014;and there came to
her a premonition of what it all meant, a vision, a picture, of the trouble that was
to come; yet, overmastering her, was a feeling of affection and loyalty for her elder
sister. Standing outside the house, that she might better watch the approach of Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e
and be on hand to greet her, she voiced her vision in song:
</p>

<p class="first">Her hostess, Hopoe, would not take the song or the farewell of Hiiaka seriously. &#x201c;You
are simply joking,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;letting your gloomy imagination run away with you.
Who in the world is driving you away, as if you had worn out your welcome?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The messenger, Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e, when she had saluted Hiiaka, said, &#x201c;I come from your
sisters. They want to see you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Arrived at Lau-pahoehoe,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e744src" href="#xd29e744">1</a> Hiiaka found her sisters in great consternation, fearing for the life of Pele if
she were allowed to continue her long sleep. Her spirit, it is true, had come back
to her body; but it was merely hovering about and had not entered and taken possession,
so that there were no signs of animation or life. It seemed to be waiting for the
voice of Hiiaka, the belovéd, to summon it back and to make it resume consciousness.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka demanded to know the cause of the wailing.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;We are lamenting our sister, the head of the family. You can see for yourself; she
is dead.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>After carefully examining the body of Pele, Hiiaka stoutly declared, &#x201c;She is not dead.
That is evident from the absence of corruption.&#x201d; Then, sitting close to Pele&#x2019;s feet,
she sang:

<h2 class="main">PELE MAKES A PROPOSITION TO HER SISTERS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That same day Pele and the other sisters returned to Kilauea, while Hiiaka went back
to resume her visit with Hopoe, each party reaching its destination at about the same
time. Early the next morning Pele called to her sister Hiiaka-i-ka-ale-i (Hiiaka-of-the-choppy-sea)
and said, &#x201c;I want you to go on an errand for me.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;No doubt I shall agree to go when you have told me what it is,&#x201d; was the answer of
the young woman.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You are to journey to Kaua&#x2019;i and escort hither our lover&#x2014;yours and mine. While on
the way you are not to lie with him; you are not to touch noses with him; you are
not to fondle him or snuggle close to him. If you do any such thing I will kill both
of you. After your return, for five days and five nights, I will have him to myself,
and after that he shall be your lover.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>On hearing this, the young woman hung her head and wept.
</p>
<p>Pele then made the same proposal to each of the other sisters in turn. Not one of
them would consent to undertake the mission. They knew full well the perils of the
undertaking: the way was beset with swarms of demons and dragons, with beings possessed
with powers of enchantment; and Pele did not offer to endow them with the power that
would safeguard them on their journey.
</p>
<p>Pele, finding herself foiled on this tack, as a diversion, said, &#x201c;Let us refresh ourselves
and have some luau.&#x201d; The sisters immediately set to work, and, when they had made
up the bundles of delicate taro leaves and were about to lay them upon the fire, Pele
called to Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e and bade her go straightway to Haena and fetch Hiiaka, &#x201c;And
you are to be back here by the time the luau is cooked.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Now the girl, whose full name was Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, was the youngest of the
sisters, and, by reason of her loveliness and accommodating disposition, she was Pele&#x2019;s
favorite. She was, moreover, gifted with a quick intuition and a clairvoyant perception
of distant happenings and coming events. At the time of the conversation between Pele
and the seven sisters, Hiiaka was sporting in the ocean with her surf-board in the
company of Hopoe. While thus engaged, the whole matter of the proposed journey to
Haena came to her as in a vision. In the midst of her surfing she turned to Hopoe
and said, &#x201c;I perceive that I am about to undertake a long journey; and during my absence
you will remain here in Puna waiting my return.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;No! What puts such a notion into your head?&#x201d; said Hopoe.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes, I must go,&#x201d; insisted Hiiaka. Then they mounted a roller, and, as their boards
touched the beach, there stood the messenger of Pele; and this was the message: &#x201c;Gird
on your paú and come with me to Kilauea. Your sister commands it.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>As the two jogged on their uphill way, an impulse seized Hiiaka, and she gave voice
to a <span class="corr" id="xd29e806" title="Source: promonition">premonition</span>, a shadow of coming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>trouble, as it were, and, standing in the road at Mokau-lele, she sang:
</p>

<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2014;true poet that she was, and alive to every colorable aspect of nature&#x2014;as she
trudged on her way, came upon a sight that touched her imagination; two birds were
sipping together in loving content of the water that had collected in the crotch of
a tree, in which also was growing an awa plant.&#x2014;Such nature-planted awa was famed
as being the most toxic of any produced in Puna.&#x2014;Her poetic mind found in the incident
something that was in harmony with her own mood, and she wove it into a song:

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka arrived at the Pit in good time to partake with the others of the frugal feast
ordered by Pele. At its conclusion, Pele turned to the girl Hiiaka and put the question
in her blunt way, &#x201c;Will you be my messenger to fetch our lover&#x2014;yours and mine&#x2014;from
Kaua&#x2019;i? Your sisters here&#x201d;&#x2014;she glanced severely about the group&#x2014;&#x201c;have refused to go.
Will you do this for me?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The little maid, true to her sense of loyalty to the woman who was her older sister,
the head of the family, and her alii, to the surprise and dismay of her other sisters,
answered, &#x201c;Yes, I will go and bring the man.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It was a shock to their sense of fitness that one so young should be sent on an errand
of such danger and magnitude; but more, it was a reproof that slapped them in the
face to have this little chit accept without hesitation a commission which they had
shrunk from through lack of courage. But they dared not say a word; they could but
scowl and roll the eye and shrug the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;When you have brought our lover here,&#x201d; continued Pele, &#x201c;for five nights and five
days he shall be mine; after that, the tabu shall be off and he shall be yours. But,
while on the way, you must not kiss him, nor fondle him, nor touch him. If you do
it will be the death of you both.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In spite of the gestured remonstrances of the group, Hiiaka, in utter self-forgetfulness
and diplomatic inexperience, agreed to Pele&#x2019;s proposition, and she framed her assent
in a form of speech that had in it the flavor of a sacrament:

Hiiaka was climbing the long ascent up the crater-pali, her sisters, anxious and appreciating
the danger of the undertaking, were quietly weeping outside the cave; but they dared
not utter a word that might come to the ears of Pele. They began, however, to beckon
and signal to Hiiaka to return. She saw them and turned back, uttering the following

The girl did not understand nor give them credit for this generous regard for herself;
she saw only their disobedience and disloyalty to Pele&#x2019;s command.
</p>
<p>Pele, impatient at her vacillation, broke out on her savagely: &#x201c;Here you are again!
Be off on your journey! You shall find no food here, no meat, no raiment, no roof,
no sisterly greeting, nothing, until you return with the man. It would have been useless
to dispatch these homely women on this errand; it seems equally useless to send a
beautiful girl like you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>To this outburst Hiiaka retorted:

<p>&#x201c;I am not grumbling or finding fault with you (<i lang="haw">loiloi</i>): it was simply because you turned back that I spoke to you. Do you call that reproaching
you?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, though a novice in diplomacy, as shown by her instant and unconditional acceptance
of Pele&#x2019;s proposition, having once got her second breath, now exacted of Pele a condition
that proved her to be, under the discipline of experience, an apt pupil in the delicate
art of diplomacy. &#x201c;I am going to bring our lover, while you remain at home. If during
my absence you go forth on one of your raids, you are welcome to ravage and consume
the lands that are common to us both; but, see to it that you do not consume my forests
of lehua. And, again, if the fit does come upon you and you must ravage and destroy,
look to it that you harm not my friend Hopoe.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Pele readily agreed to Hiiaka&#x2019;s reasonable demand, thinking thus to hasten her departure.
To the inexperienced girl the terms of the agreement seemed now complete and satisfactory,
and, in the first blush of her gratification, Hiiaka gave expression to her pleasure:

two mele which the story-tellers have given us as belonging to two separate incidents
in Hiiaka&#x2019;s fence with Pele.)
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Your request is reasonable,&#x201d; said Pele; &#x201c;to travel alone is indeed to converse with
one&#x2019;s shadow. You shall have a companion.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Pele designated a good-natured waiting woman as her attendant, who had the poetical
name of Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e (or Paú-o-palaá). This faithful creature heartily accepted the
trust, that of <i lang="haw">kahu</i>&#x2014;a servant with the pseudo responsibility of a guardian&#x2014;and, having expressed her
fealty to her new mistress, she at once took her station. Thus everything seemed arranged
for a start on the eventful journey.
</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of Hiiaka&#x2019;s going were not even yet to the satisfaction of
her watchful sisters and relatives. One matter of vital importance had been omitted
from the outfit: Pele had not bestowed upon Hiiaka the <i lang="haw">mana</i>, power and authority, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>to overcome and subdue all the foes that would surely rise up to oppose and defeat
her. With wild gestures they signalled to Hiiaka once more to return.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka&#x2019;s answering song, though pointed with blame, gives proof that her own intuitions
were not entirely at fault:
</p>

<p class="first">The communication between Hiiaka and her sisters had, on their part, been carried
on mostly by means of gesture and sign-language. But on this return of Hiiaka the
whole family of brothers and sisters were so moved at the thought of the danger to
Hiiaka that they spoke out at last and frankly advised Hiiaka to go before Pele and
demand of her the gift of spiritual power, <i lang="haw">mana</i>, that she might be able to meet her enemies on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>equal terms at least, so that she need not feel powerless in their presence. But nothing
came of this move at the time, for at this moment out came Pele from her cave, and,
seeing Hiiaka standing with the others, she addressed her sharply and said: &#x201c;What!
You still here? Why are you not on the way to fetch our man?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Face to face with Pele, Hiiaka&#x2019;s courage oozed away and she promised to make another
start in the morning. When on this new start she had come near the top of the ascent,
she turned about and sang:
</p>

</p>
<p class="line">The Woman, why silent her voice?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Hiiaka now made common cause with the group of sisters and relatives who were bent
on securing for her justice and fair treatment. Among them, taking council together,
sat Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai, Kapo and Pohakau<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1083src" href="#xd29e1083">6</a>. By this action Hiiaka took a new attitude: while not coming out in open defiance
to her sister, she virtually declared her determination no longer to be domineered
over by Pele.
</p>
<p>In the council that took place it was determined that Ka-moho-alii, who stood high
in Pele&#x2019;s regards and whose authority was second only to hers, was the proper one
to approach Pele in the matter of conferring upon Hiiaka the necessary mana. When,
therefore, Pele put to Hiiaka the question why she had returned, why she was not on
her journey, Ka-moho-alii spoke up and said, &#x201c;It is because of fear she has returned.
She sees danger by the way. You have not given her the mana to protect her from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>dragons and monsters that infest the road. <i lang="haw">O Mo&#x2019;o-lau ke ala, e</i>: The way is beset by dragons four hundred.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Ah, that is the trouble?&#x201d; said Pele. Then she called upon the Sun, the Moon, the
Stars, Wind, Rain, Thunder, Lightning&#x2014;all the heavenly powers&#x2014;to aid and safeguard
Hiiaka and she authorized her to exercise the powers of these heavenly beings. The
gods, thereupon, ratified this act of Pele; and at last the way was made clear for
Hiiaka&#x2019;s departure.

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA STARTS ON HER JOURNEY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The refusal of her sisters to undertake the mission to fetch Lohiau had angered Hiiaka.
Her intrepid fealty to Pele, their oldest sister and their alii, laughed to scorn
the perils of the journey. She could not and, for a time, would not bring herself
to understand their prudential attitude. Pele was their alii, and it was rank disloyalty
in them to shirk any danger or to decline any command Pele might think fit to impose.
In judging the conduct of her sisters, it did not at first enter the head of Hiiaka
that motives of sound worldly prudence justified them in declining for themselves
an errand full of danger, or in putting obstacles in the way of her going on the same
errand: she saw in it only a failure to rise to the level of her own loyalty.
</p>
<p>The situation, then, was heavily charged with estrangement, and when the woman in
Hiiaka could not refrain from one more farewell, the color and tone of voice and song
had in them the snap of electricity:
</p>

<p>On reaching the plateau of Wahine-kapu Hiiaka received a spiritual message telling
her that Lohiau&#x2014;the object of her errand&#x2014;was dead. She at once turned towards Pele

like the stays of a spider-web, and they were nearing the borders of Pana-ewa, when

<p>&#x201c;I am not the one you are seeking: I am not Pele,&#x201d; said Hiiaka. &#x201c;Pele is over yonder
in the Pit.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The woman was persistent and begged that Hiiaka would not despise her offering. After
undeceiving her, Hiiaka carefully instructed her, lest she make some fatal mistake
in her approach to the jealous goddess: &#x201c;When you come to the Pit you must be careful
in your approach to Pele. The least departure from the etiquette she demands would
be the cause of your death. Do not imagine that the fine large woman sitting at the
door is Pele, nor that any one of the women seated within is she. You must pay no
attention to these. Look for the figure of a wrinkled old woman lying bundled up on
the hearth: that is Pele: make the offering to no one else but to her.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;Alas for me,&#x201d; said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o. &#x201c;You will be gone a long way from this place by
the time I shall return to seek you. I shall not be able to find you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You will find us here,&#x201d; replied Hiiaka assuringly.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka used her power to bring the woman at once to her destination. Following the
instructions given her, Wahine-oma&#x2019;o was quickly transported into the presence of
Pele and, having made her offering in due form, was about to retire, when Pele called
her back and said, &#x201c;Did you not meet some women going from here as you came this way?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I met some women,&#x201d; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Make haste and come up with them,&#x201d; said Pele. &#x201c;The younger woman is very dear to
me. Attach yourself to her as a friend.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;That I will do,&#x201d; said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o. Then, moved by an impulse that came to her (the
work, it is said, of Hiiaka), she said to Pele, &#x201c;I had imagined you to be a beautiful
woman, Pele. But, lo, you are old and wrinkled; and your eyes are red and watery.&#x201d;
Thus saying, <span class="corr" id="xd29e1233" title="Source: Wahine&#x2019;oma&#x2019;o">Wahine-oma&#x2019;o</span> took her departure and almost immediately found herself again with Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You have made quick time,&#x201d; Hiiaka said. &#x201c;How did you get on?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I followed your instructions and presented my offering to the woman who was lying
on the hearth. She asked me if I had met you, and when I said yes, she told me to
look after you as a friend.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;She also told me to watch you, to observe how you behaved towards the man&#x2014;whether
you kissed him or had any dalliance with him.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;And did you say anything to Pele?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;U-m, I bantered her about her looks; told her she was a very ill-favored woman, while
the women attending her were very handsome.&#x201d;
</p>
<p class="xd29e1243">Hiiaka laughed at this naive account.
</p>
<p>Night shut down upon them at Kuolo, a place just on the border of Pana-ewa. Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e
proposed that they should seek a resting place for the night with the people of the
hamlet. Hiiaka would not hear to it: &#x201c;Travelers should sleep in the open, in the road;
in that way they can rise and resume their journey with no delay.&#x201d; (<i lang="haw">O ka po&#x2019;e hele he pono ia lakou e moe i ke alanui, i ala no a hele no.</i>)

<h2 class="main">THE GIRL PA-PULEHU&#x2014;THE FEAST</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the morning while it was still dark, they roused and started afresh. Their way
led through lehua groves of the most luxuriant growth, the bloom of which crimsons
the landscape to this day, exuding a honey that is most attractive to the birds of
heaven. The cool still air wafted to their ears the hum of voices which was soon explained
when they came upon a bevy of girls who were busily plucking the bright flowers to
string into wreaths and garlands, in anticipation of some entertainment. This rural
scene made an appeal to the poet in Hiiaka which she could not resist:
</p>
<div id="lg27.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A Wai-akea, i ka Hilo-hana-kahi,

<p class="line">E pauku ana no ka hala me ka lehua.
</p>
<p class="line">Maikai Hilo, o Hilo-hana-kahi!</p>
</div>
<p class="first transh">TRANSLATION
</p>
<div id="lg27.2" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">At Wai-akea, in Hilo&#x2014;
</p>
<p class="line">The Hilo of Hana-kahi&#x2014;
</p>
<p class="line">They rise in the early morning
</p>
<p class="line">To weave fresh wreaths of lehua,
</p>
<p class="line">Inbeading its bloom with hala&#x2014;
</p>
<p class="line">Gay Hilo of Hana-kahi!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At sight of Hiiaka&#x2019;s party, the lively flower-girls made a rush, as if to capture
and appropriate their friendly acquaintance for individual possession. The most vivacious
and forward of the whole party was Pa-pulehu, their leader, a buxom young woman, of
good family, who at once took possession of Hiiaka for herself, crowned and bedecked
her with wreaths and garlands, with many expressions of enthusiastic admiration: &#x201c;This
is <i>my</i> friend!&#x2014;What a beauty!&#x2014;How the scarlet lehua becomes her!&#x2014;Just look, girls!&#x2014;And now
you are to come and be my guest.&#x2014;The feast is set for this very day.&#x2014;But you are all
welcome.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The unrestrained gush of the young woman&#x2019;s rattling talk was quite in contrast to
the selected words of Hiiaka.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now Pa-pulehu was of a large and important family, embracing numerous friends and
relations, and, having ample means, her hospitalities were unstinted. The report spread
quickly, &#x201c;Pa-pulehu has a distinguished guest come to visit her. There is to be a
feast this afternoon. All are invited.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The tables were spread with a great variety of fish, meats, fruits and vegetables.
The parents and guardians of the girl, nevertheless, came to her and inquired, &#x201c;What
is there that this young woman, your friend, would specially like to eat?&#x201d; Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e
took it upon her to answer, that the one thing that would be most acceptable to Hiiaka
would be a dish of luau. Thereupon a large quantity of young and delicate taro leaves
were prepared for the table.
</p>
<p>When they were gathered at the tables, Hiiaka sitting in the place of honor, Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e,
at her request, bade all the people incline their heads and close their eyes. Then
Hiiaka called upon her allies, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the elements and all
the gods to come to the feast and partake; and when the prayer was ended and they
opened their eyes&#x2014;lo, the tables spread for Hiiaka were empty! Hiiaka had not been
seen to take into her hands any of the food that was spread before her. It had vanished
away as a drop of water evaporates in the heat of the sun.
</p>
<p>The feast being concluded, Hiiaka rose, bade good bye to the people and resumed her
journey, taking with her Pa-pulehu.
</p>
<p>This girl Pa-pulehu was of genuine flesh and blood, with no blend of divine ichor
in her veins, such as enriched the blood of Hiiaka; nor had she, like Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
and Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e, been strengthened and made more resistant to spiritual and physical
foes&#x2014;a privilege granted to those who had enjoyed a close approach to Pele as attendants
and worshippers. This weakness in her nature had its influence in determining the
fate to which her history now quickly leads.
</p>
<p>Their journey still lay through Puna. They were at Kalalau, not far from Haena (at
the place where, centuries afterwards, Kamehameha was struck with that well-nigh fatal
blow by an outraged fisherman). Some fishermen were hauling in their nets full of
fish. The sight was too much for Pa-pulehu. &#x201c;I hunger for fish,&#x201d; she <span class="corr" id="xd29e1286" title="Source: xeclaimed">exclaimed</span>. &#x201c;These fish belong to my father. Oh, if I only were at home! how I would eat until
I was satisfied!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka thought it best to indulge the appetite of this novice in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>her service. From a little knoll overlooking the ocean, she descried the canoe of
a fisherman named Pahulu floating in the offing, but already well stocked with fish.
Hiiaka used her power and drove away the school of fish that would have come to his
net. The man himself was so intent on his work that he had no eyes for what was passing
on shore; but his assistant exclaimed, &#x201c;Look at the beautiful woman standing on the
shore and watching us!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I must keep my eyes on my nets,&#x201d; the fisherman replied.
</p>
<p>Thereupon Hiiaka attracted his attention with a song:
</p>
<div id="lg29.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Nani ku a ka Hilo pali-ku!
</p>
<p class="line">O ka au-hula ana o Ka-lalau,
</p>
<p class="line">O ka au alana loa i kai, e!
</p>
<p class="line">Ho mai he i&#x2019;a, na ka pehu o uka, ea.</p>
</div>
<p class="first transh">TRANSLATION
</p>
<div id="lg29.2" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A standing wonder, Hilo cliffs!
</p>
<p class="line">How daring this Ka-lalau swimming,
</p>
<p class="line">Far out to sea on a floating plank!
</p>
<p class="line">Pray grant us, O man, of your fish&#x2014;
</p>
<p class="line">Fish for the herb-swollen rustic.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This brought the two fishermen ashore who thereupon willingly parted with some of
their fish to Hiiaka, coupling the gift, however, with a proposition insulting to
the honor of the two women. The fishermen, imagining they had the two women under
their power, were soon after seen lying in the open embracing two figures of stone
which they, in their insane infatuation, fancied were the two women, thus exposing
themselves to the jeers and derision of their fellows.
</p>
<p>Pa-pulehu cooked and ate the fish, but her manner of eating was lacking in due punctilio,
in that she did not dispose properly of the unconsumed parts&#x2014;the tails, fins, bones
and scales&#x2014;of the fish. She should have burned or buried them; instead she left them
lying about in a slovenly way. This neglect was highly offensive to Pele and caused
her to withdraw from Pa-pulehu the protection she otherwise would have given her.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">HIIAKA CHOOSES THE ROUTE THROUGH PANA-EWA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two routes offered themselves for Hiiaka&#x2019;s choice, a makai road, circuitous but safe,
the one ordinarily pursued by travelers; the other direct but bristling with danger,
because it traversed the territory of the redoubtable witch-mo&#x2019;o, Pana-ewa. Hiiaka
had deigned to appeal to the girl Pa-pulehu, she being a kamaaina<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1318src" href="#xd29e1318">1</a>, as if for information. When Hiiaka announced her determination to take the short
road, the one of danger that struck through the heart of Pana-ewa, Pa-pulehu drew
back in dismay and expostulated: &#x201c;That is not a fit road for us, or for any but a
band of warriors. If we go that way we shall be killed.&#x201d; She broke forth with lamentations,
bewailing her coming fate and the desolation that was about to visit her family.
</p>
<p>As they advanced Wahine-oma&#x2019;o descried a gray scare-crow object motionless in the
road ahead of them. She thought it to be the blasted stump of a kukui tree. Hiiaka
recognized its true character, the witch-form taken as a disguise by a mo&#x2019;o. It was
a scout sent out by Pana-ewa; in real character a hag, but slimed with a gray excrement
to give it closer resemblance to a mouldering tree-stump. The deceiving art of magic
did not avail against Hiiaka. She rushed forward to give the death stroke to the foul
thing, which at once groveled in the dirt in its true form.
</p>
<p>Night overtook them in a dense forest. While the others lay and slept, Hiiaka reconnoitered
the situation. The repose of the wilderness was unbroken save for the restless flitting
of a solitary bird that peered at Hiiaka obtrusively. It was a spy in the employ of
Pana-ewa and its actions roused the lively suspicions of Hiiaka, eliciting from her
an appropriate incantation:
</p>

<p class="first">It was a subtle temptation that suggested the awa cup as a relief for her troubles.
Hiiaka had need that all her faculties should give her their best service. For her
to have slept at this time would have been fatal. Her song well expressed it:

<p>Pana-ewa entrusted the work of <span class="corr" id="xd29e1378" title="Source: reconnoisance">reconnaissance</span> and scouting for information to two of his creatures named Ke-anini and Ihi-kalo,
while he lay down and slept. Having done their work, the two scouts waked the drowsy
monster in the middle of the night with the information that four human beings, women,
had entered his domain and were coming towards him. &#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Out in this direction (pointing), and they are moving this way.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Well, this day of fasting has gone by. What a pity, however, that the poi in my calabash
has turned sour, but the taro is sweet. Eye-balls! what juicy, delicious morsels!
The day of privation turns out to be a day of feasting.&#x201d; Thus muttered the cannibal
monster, gloating like Polyphemus in his cave at the prospect of a feast.

<p>Hiiaka kept her own courage at the fine point of seeming indifference, she also inspired
her companions with the same feeling by the calm confidence displayed in her singing:

of witchcraft, inflamed with the spite of demons, was hideous and uncanny. Tooth and
claw ran amuck. Flesh was torn, limbs rent apart, blood ran like water. If it had
been only a battle with enemies in the open Hiiaka would have made short work of the
job. Her foes lay ambushed in every wood and brake and assumed every imaginable disguise.
A withered bush, a bunch of grass, a moss-grown stone, any, the most innocent object
in nature, might prove to be an assailant ready to spit venom or tear with hook and
talon. Hiiaka had need of every grain of wit and every spark of courage in her nature.
Nothing could withstand her onset and the billows of attack against her person were
broken as by a solid rock. Some described her as wielding a flaming battle-ax and
hurling missiles of burning sulphur. They might well be deceived. The quickness of
her every motion was a counterfeit of the riving blade or blazing fire-ball. Some
assert that, in her frenzy, she tore with her teeth and even devoured the reeking
flesh until her stomach rose in rebellion. Such a notion seems incompatible with the
violence of her disgust for the reptilian blood that besmeared her from sole to crown.
</p>
<p>Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e, using her magical paú as a besom of destruction, was transformed into
a veritable Bellona; and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o displayed the courage of an amazon. These both
escaped serious injury. The unhappy fate of Pa-pulehu realized that girl&#x2019;s premonition.
She fell into the hands of the enemy and, as if to fulfill the prediction of Pele,
became &#x201c;food for the gods of Pana-ewa.&#x201d;

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA&#x2019;S BATTLE WITH <span class="corr" id="xd29e1593" title="Source: PANAEWA">PANA-EWA</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The bird-spies sent out by Pana-ewa brought back contradictory reports. The first
pair reported that Hiiaka was being worsted. Soon after another pair, garbling the
facts, said &#x201c;Our people are lying down, but they are still alert and keep their eyes
open. As for Hiiaka, she has fallen into a deep sleep.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The situation was far from satisfactory and Pana-ewa despatched another pair of birds
to reconnoitre and report. It was not yet morning and the night was dark; and they
accordingly took the form of kukui<a class="noteref" id="xd29e1598src" href="#xd29e1598">1</a> trees, thinking thus to illuminate the scene of operations. The intelligence they
brought was confounding: &#x201c;Our people,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;are all dead, save those who have
the form of kukui trees. Hiiaka lies quietly sleeping in the road.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>This account, though strictly in accord with the facts, was so disconcerting to Pana-ewa
that he burst forth in a rage, &#x201c;Slaves, liars! you&#x2019;re deceiving me. I&#x2019;ll wring your
necks!&#x201d; and he reached out to execute his threat. The birds eluded him and found safety
in flight.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pana-ewa now saw that it was necessary to take the field in person at the head of
his regular forces, composed of the Namú and Nawá. The disguise he chose for himself
was that of an ohia-lehua tree. No sooner had he taken that form than he found himself
unable to move hand or foot. A parasitic network of i-e-i-e embraced his body and
a multitude of aërial roots anchored him to the spot. It was the craft of the sleeping
girl that had done this. He had to content himself with the unwarlike guise of the
kukui tree.
</p>
<p>While Hiiaka slept, her faithful servitor Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e kept open eye and detective
ear to what was going on in the star-lit forest about them. At the first glimmering
of dawn her keen sense felt rather than heard a murmurous rustle that broke the stillness
and a movement, as if the forest itself were advancing and closing in upon them. This
oncoming of the enemy was in such contrast to the onset of the yelping pack on the
previous day as to be most impressive. The sound that touched her keen sense was not
the joyous twitter and stir of nature preparing to greet a new day; it was rather
the distant mutter of the storm, soon to be heard as the growl of the tempest, or
the roar and snarl of an enraged menagerie of wild beasts.
</p>
<p>The woman felt her responsibility and, with the double intent of summoning to their
aid the friendly gods and of waking Hiiaka, she lifted a solemn prayer:

<p class="first">The sisters, uncles, aunts and other kindred of Hiiaka heard this prayer of Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e
distinctly enough, and so did Pele; and when they saw that she appeared indifferent
and made no move, they muttered among themselves. Then Ku-ili-kaua, a man of war and
a leader in battle, spoke up and, addressing Ka-moho-alii, said &#x201c;Why is it that she
does not send warriors to the assistance of her sister? The girl has fought most bravely
all day and is worn out; and there she lies fast asleep.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Ka-moho-alii thereupon bade Kilioe-i-ka-pua and Olu-wale-i-malo, two handsome lads
who were very dear to Pele (<i lang="haw">mau keiki punahele a Pele</i>)&#x2014;her sons in fact&#x2014;to go in to Pele and ask her sanction to their going to the aid
of Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>When these two boys came into Pele&#x2019;s presence they found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>her poking the fire with a stick (<i lang="haw">hoelo kapuahi</i>). With a fine show of confidence, they at once went and seated themselves in Pele&#x2019;s
lap, one on her right thigh and one on her left. Pele&#x2019;s looks softened as she contemplated
them, tears gathered in her eyes and she said, &#x201c;What is the thought in the heart?
Speak.&#x201d; (<i lang="haw">Heaha ka hua i ka umauma? Ha&#x2019;i&#x2019;na.</i>)
</p>

</p>
<p>At this Pele stood up and, leaving her own home-hearth, went over and took her station
in the fire-pit of Hale-ma&#x2019;u-ma&#x2019;u. Then, pointing to the east, she said:

<p class="first">Thus chanting their battle-mele (<i lang="haw">mele ka&#x2019;i kaua</i>), these gods of an old-time mythology marched, or flew, with resolute purpose to
their task of rescuing Hiiaka and her little band and of ridding the land, at one
and the same stroke, of their old <span class="corr" id="xd29e2231" title="Source: intrenched">entrenched</span> foe, Pana-ewa. Heaven and earth stirred at their onset. The visible signs of their
array were manifest in columns of seething fire-shot clouds that hovered like vultures
over the advancing army. Arrived at striking distance, they let loose their lightning-bolts
and sounded their thunder-gongs. Earth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>and heaven at once became turmoiled in one confused whirl of warring elements.
</p>
<p>The warriors of Pana-ewa, who&#x2014;in imitation of their chief&#x2014;had for the most part taken
the guise of trees and other natural objects, found themselves from the first fettered
and embarrassed by a tangle of parasitic vines, so that their thrusts against Hiiaka
were of little avail. Now comes the onset of the Pele gods in the tempest-forms of
hurricane, lightning, hail, and watery cloud-bursts that opened heaven&#x2019;s flood-gates.
Against these elemental forces the dryad-forms of Pana-ewa&#x2019;s host could not stand
for a moment. Their tree-shapes were riven and torn limb from limb, engulfed in a
swirling tide that swept them down to the ocean and far out to sea.
</p>
<p>Two staunch fighters remained, Kiha, who had chosen to retain the honest dragon-form;
and Pua&#x2019;a-loa, a creature, like Kama-pua&#x2019;a, in the demi-shape of a boar, whom Pana-ewa,
at the scent of disaster, had thrust into the confinement of a secret cave. This manner
of retreat saved the twain from the immediate disaster by flood but not from the vengeance
of Pele&#x2019;s army. Detected in their lairs, they were slain and their petrified bodies
are pointed out to this day in verification of this story.
</p>
<p>The fate of Pana-ewa himself was most tragical. He no sooner had taken the form of
a kukui tree than he found himself overlaid and entangled with meshes of parasitic
growth; he could neither fight nor fly. The spot on which he stood sank and became
a swamp, a lake, a sink; the foundations on which its bottom rested were broken up
and fell away. Pana-ewa, swallowed up in the gulf, was swept out to sea and perished
in the waves. Kane-lu-honua had broken up the underlying strata and made of the place
a bottomless sink.
</p>
<p>(A reef is pointed out in the ocean opposite Papa&#x2019;i which is the remains of the body
of the mo&#x2019;o Pana-ewa.)
</p>
<p>The part taken by Hiiaka in this last act of her deliverance was hardly more than
that of a spectator. She had but to look on and witness the accomplishment of her
own salvation. Having been <span class="corr" id="xd29e2242" title="Source: rousedfrom">roused from</span> the refreshment of sleep by the long-drawn recitative of Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e&#x2019;s prayer-mele
(see pp. <a href="#pb37">37</a>&#x2013;<a href="#pb40">40</a>), she did her best to cheer her two companions with assurances of coming deliverance
and, gathering her little brood about her, after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>manner of a mother-hen, figuratively, bade them cling to her, nestle under her wings,
lest they should be swept away in the flood of waters that soon began to surge about
them&#x2014;a flood which carried far out to sea the debris of battle&#x2014;as already described.
</p>
<p>The victory for Hiiaka was complete. Hawaii for once, and for all time, was rid of
that pestilential, man-eating, mo&#x2019;o band headed by Pana-ewa who, from the time of
Pele&#x2019;s coming, had remained entrenched in the beautiful forest-land that still bears
the name&#x2014;Pana-ewa.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At one stroke, the benign action of the heavenly powers had freed a fair land from
a pestilential mo&#x2019;o band, disinfected it of the last shred and fragment of their carcases
and ushered in a reign of peace in the wooded parks and tangled forests of <span class="corr" id="xd29e2260" title="Source: Pan-ewa">Pana-ewa</span>. Hiiaka could afford to celebrate her victory by recuperating her powers in well-earned
repose. While she thus lay in profound sleep on the purified battle-field, her two
companions busied themselves in preparing such simple refreshment as the wilderness
afforded. The <i lang="fr">piece de resistance</i> of this dinner of herbs was luau, the favorite food of the Pele family.
</p>
<p>When the women had finished the task of collecting, sorting, making into bundles and
cooking the delicate leaves of kalo, Hiiaka still slept. Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e thereupon took
her station at the feet of her mistress and chanted the dinner-call in the form of
a gentle serenade:
</p>

</p>
<div id="lg47.1" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Daughter of heaven,
</p>
<p class="line">Awake, awake!
</p>
<p class="line">Hiiaka, awake!
</p>
<p class="line">Sender of winter rain,
</p>
<p class="line">Guardian of womanly rites,
</p>
<p class="line">Spouse of God Maka-li&#x2019;i,
</p>
<p class="line">Awake thee, awake!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&#x201c;The luau must be burnt to a crisp,&#x201d; Hiiaka said as she sat up.
</p>
<p>As Hiiaka and her companions again wended their way through the forest, it was evident
that its innocent creatures had unjustly suffered in company with their guilty invaders
and time had not yet sufficed for the exercise of that miracle of tropic repair which
quickly heals and covers the damage done by a tempest. Broken limbs, fallen trees
and twisted vines still blocked the narrow trails, while here and there an uprooted
forest giant, in unseemly fashion, obtruded a Medusa-head of tawny roots in place
of its comely coronal of leaves.
</p>
<p>In their journey they came at length to a place, Maka&#x2019;u-kiu, where the road seemingly
ended abruptly in a precipice with the ocean dashing wildly at its base. The alternative
open to their choice was, to seek out some round-about inland way, or to take the
shorter route and swim the ocean-made gap. The two women, Wahine-oma&#x2019;o taking the
lead, proposed, as a diversion, to swim the ocean and thus avoid a long and wearisome
detour. Hiiaka strenuously vetoed the proposition; but the two women, not yet trained
to subordinate their will and judgment to the decision of the leader, persisted. Hiiaka,
thereupon, took a stem of the ti plant and, peeling off its rusty bark, left it white
and easily visible. &#x201c;I will throw this stick into the water,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;and if it
disappears we will not make of this an <i lang="haw">au-hula-ana</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2292src" href="#xd29e2292">1</a> but if it remains in sight, then we will swim across this wild piece of water.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>It seemed to Hiiaka that her companions displayed a masculine stubbornness and unreasonableness,
a criticism which she uttered in her chanting way:

<p class="first">Hiiaka then threw the peeled stick into the ocean and in a moment it was snatched
out of sight. &#x201c;There! If we were to swim we would be seized and eaten by Maka&#x2019;u-kiu.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;When you tossed the stick into the ocean, the sea-moss covered and concealed it,
and you thought it was the work of a shark,&#x201d; was the reply of Wahine-oma&#x2019;o. Again
they made ready to plunge into the sea. Hiiaka threw another stick and that too was
instantly swallowed; whereupon she chanted again:

Hiiaka another remonstrance:

</div>
<p class="first">At these words the huge form of the shark rose to the surface, and the women, convinced
at last, leaped out of the water and abandoned their purpose. Hiiaka now gave battle
to the shark and that was the end of one more power of evil.

<p class="first">The location of the adventure with the shark-god Maka&#x2019;u-kiu<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2368src" href="#xd29e2368">1</a> was at the mouth of <span class="corr" id="xd29e2373" title="Source: Waipi&#x2019;o">Wai-pi&#x2019;o</span> valley, a region where Hawaii&#x2019;s storm-coast forms an impassable rampart, save as
it is cut by this and its twin valley, Wai-manu. These valleys take head in a wild
forest region, the home of mist, rain and swamp. Adjoining this and part of the same
watershed is the region known as Mahiki-waena, a land which the convenience of traffic
required should be open to travel. It was the haunt of a ferocious horde of mo&#x2019;o called
mahiki<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2376src" href="#xd29e2376">2</a> from their power to leap and spring like grass-hoppers.
</p>
<p>When Hiiaka proposed to pass through this region in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>ordinary course of travel, the head of the Mahiki insolently denied her the right
of way, suggesting as an alternative the boisterous sea-route around the northern
shoulder of Hawaii. Hiiaka&#x2019;s blood was up. The victory over the hosts of Pana-ewa
and the more recent destruction of Maka&#x2019;u-kiu had fired her courage. She resolved
once for all to make an end of this arrogant nuisance and to rid the island of the
whole pestilential brood of imps and mo&#x2019;o. Standing on a height that overlooked Wai-pi&#x2019;o,
she chanted a mele which is at once descriptive of the scene before her and at the
same time expressive of her determination:

<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s march to encounter the Mahiki was interrupted for a short time by an incident
that only served to clinch her resolution. An agonizing cry of distress assailed her
ear. It came from a dismantled heap of human flesh, the remains of two men who had
been most brutally handled&#x2014;by these same Mahiki, perhaps&#x2014;their leg and arm-bones plucked
out and they left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>to welter in their misery. It was seemingly the cruel infliction of the Mahiki. The
cry of the two wretches could not be disregarded:

<p class="first">Hiiaka, with a skill that did credit to her surgery, splinted the maimed limbs, inserting
stems from her favorite ti plant to take the place of the long bones that had been
removed. She left them seated in comfort at the roadside at Pololú.
</p>
<p>The Mahiki, on seeing Hiiaka advance into their territory, threw up the dirt and dust
in their front, to express their contempt for such an <span class="corr" id="xd29e2440" title="Source: insiginficant">insignificant</span> body of trespassers. Hiiaka, paying no attention to their insolence, pressed on.
Her purpose was to strike directly at Mo&#x2019;o-lau, the leader of the horde, to whom she
addressed this incantation:

whom the Mahiki chief had sent as a spy to watch Hiiaka, was seen standing on a high
place to one side of them. Hiiaka at once flew at her and put an end to her.
</p>
<p>Now began a fierce battle between Hiiaka and the Mahiki dragon and his forces. They
fought till both sides were exhausted and then, as if by mutual consent, stopped to
rest.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka perceived that the battle was to be even more fiercely contested than that
at Pana-ewa. She bade Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e to take good care that no ill came to Wahine-oma&#x2019;o.
Looking up into the heavens, Hiiaka saw her relatives and friends Poha-kau, Ka-moho-alii,
Kane-milo-hai, and a large concourse of other gods, including Kane, Kanaloa, Ku and
Lono, watching her, evidently greatly interested in her performances. They assured
her of their protection. At this Hiiaka was much encouraged and gave utterance to
her feelings in this kanaenae:

Thereupon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>they turned their attack against that old dragon and his guards. Hiiaka then celebrated

<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s chief weapon of attack seems to have been her magical paú. With this as a
besom she beat them down as a husbandman might beat down a swarm of locusts. The Mahiki
and the Mo&#x2019;o-lau had ceased to exist as organized bodies. But from the rout and slaughter
of the armies many individuals had escaped with their lives, and these had hid themselves
away in caves and secret places, some of them even, presuming apparently upon their
power of disguise, had taken refuge in the remote scattered habitations of the people.
Such an inference seems to be justified by the language of the mele now to be given:
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p id="note54" class="note54"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&#x2014;The gods that came to the assistance of Hiiaka such times as circumstances pinched
her and whose spiritual power at all times reënforced her feeble humanity were limited
in their dominion to certain vaguely defined provinces and departments. Thus, if there
was any sea-fighting to be done, it fell to the shark-god, the Admiral Ka-moho-alii,
to take charge of it. On the other hand, the conduct of a battle on <i>terra firma</i> would be under the generalship of Kane-milo-hai; while to Kana-loa belonged the marshalling
of the celestial hosts, the moon and the stars. But the orb of day, the Sun, belonged
to Lono. Hence, if the fighting was during the hours of daylight, Lono would logically
assume the command. The rule of the great god Ku was also exercised principally by
day. It was he who arranged the calendar and settled the order of the seasons, the
days and the nights. The subdivisions and departmental complications under these general
divisions were numerous.

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA LOOPS BACK IN HER JOURNEY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka, having thus far, as it would seem, journeyed along the western coast of Hawaii,
now loops back in her course and travels in the direction of Hilo by the way of Hamakua,
for the seeming purpose of completing her work of extermination. Like a wise general,
she would leave no enemies in her rear.
</p>
<p>When they came into the neighborhood of Wahine-oma&#x2019;o&#x2019;s home, that girl spoke up and
said, &#x201c;I think we had better take another road. If we keep to this one, which passes
by my door, my parents, who will be watching for me, will see me and will want me
to remain with them.&#x201d; This she said by reason of her great desire to continue in Hiiaka&#x2019;s
company. True enough, when they caught sight of her old home, there sat her mother
Puna-hoa and her father Kai-pala-oa.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;There they sit,&#x201d; said the girl. &#x201c;If they recognize me they will want to keep me.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka bade Wahine-oma&#x2019;o fall in behind her, hunch her shoulders, bend forward her
head and walk with short infirm steps in imitation of an old woman. Hiiaka, on coming
close to the old people, using the language of song, asked directions as to the road:
</p>
<div id="lg56.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">

</p>
<p class="line">You with the clear-scanning eyes,
</p>
<p class="line">Sitting at rest before me,
</p>
<p class="line">Point me out now the road.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&#x201c;The road is plain enough; you are taking the right way.&#x2026; We are looking at that young
woman of your party&#x2014;she has such a strong resemblance to our missing daughter, save
her way of shuffling and holding her head.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>On reaching the outskirts of the village of Hilo, Hiiaka found a rickety foot-bridge,
consisting of a single narrow and wobbly plank, liable to turn at every step and precipitate
the passenger into the tumbling waters below&#x2014;and this was the only passage across
the rocky chasm of the Wai-luku<a class="noteref" id="xd29e2609src" href="#xd29e2609">1</a> river. This precarious crossing was the work of two sorcerers, degenerate nondescripts,
who had the audacity to levy toll for the use of their bridge, in default of which
the traveler suddenly found himself precipitated into the raging water. By virtue
of their necromantic powers, they had the presumption to claim spiritual kinship with
Hiiaka, a bond the woman could not absolutely repudiate.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Here comes our mo&#x2019;o-puna,<span class="corr" id="xd29e2617" title="Not in source">&#x201d;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd29e2618src" href="#xd29e2618">2</a> called out Pili-a-mo&#x2019;o to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Well, what of it? She will have to pay her fare the same as anyone else,&#x201d; replied
Noho-a-mo&#x2019;o. &#x201c;Only on that condition shall she cross by our bridge.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>On Hiiaka&#x2019;s attempting to cross without paying toll, the two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>sorcerers would, following their own practice, have disarranged the treacherous plank
and precipitated her and her party into the raging stream.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Well said,&#x201d; Noho-a-mo&#x2019;o replied; &#x201c;provided she will consent to it.&#x201d;

wanting in those generous feelings that belong to godhood. &#x201c;These creatures are simply
mo&#x2019;o. If I attack them, they will run for their lives.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The people, failing to recognize Hiiaka as their deliverer, spiritless from long habituation
to the fraudulent dominion of these imposters, fearful also of their vengeance, stoutly
opposed Hiiaka, affirming that Pili-a-mo&#x2019;o and Noho-a-mo&#x2019;o were gods in reality, having
great power and capable of doing many wonderful things. They declared their readiness
to back their opinion with their property, yes, with their lives. They were at length
persuaded, however, to accept as decisive the test proposed by Hiiaka, namely, that,
if they fled when attacked, they should cease to be regarded as gods and should be
dealt with as imposters.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>True to Hiiaka&#x2019;s prediction, the mo&#x2019;o, in abject fear, turned and fled for their lives

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was at this point of the journey that Hiiaka lost the attendance of her sympathetic
companion and faithful servant, Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e. She was persuaded to unite her fortunes
with those of a man from Kohala named Pa-ki&#x2019;i; and we must leave unanswered the question,
how she finally settled with Pele this apparent desertion of the trust with which
she had been charged, that of acting as aide, kahu, to Hiiaka. Wahine-oma&#x2019;o now remains
as the sole companion of Hiiaka in her future adventures.
</p>
<p>On resuming the journey they came before long to the broad stream of <span class="corr" id="xd29e2756" title="Source: Honolii">Honoli&#x2019;i</span>, which was swimming deep and, in the lack of other means of crossing, they bundled
their clothes, held them above their heads with one hand and easily made the opposite
shore by swimming with the aid of the other hand.
</p>
<p>At the sight of this performance, the ghost-god, Hina-hina-ku-i-ka-pali and her companion,
in a spirit of pure fault-finding and Mother-Grundyism, exclaimed:

</div>
<p class="first">&#x201c;For shame!&#x201d; said Hiiaka. &#x201c;These ghost-gods have been spying on our nakedness, and
now they make sport of us.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>A great fear came upon the ghosts, that the dread goddess would seize them and pinch
out their atomy spark of existence. In their terror, they flew home and, perched on
the shoulders of their mother, besought her to interpose in their behalf and appease
Hiiaka by a suitable offering of luau.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;There burns a fire,&#x201d; said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, as they drew near the house.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The fire of the ovens built by the ghosts,&#x201d; Hiiaka answered. &#x201c;They have saved themselves
from death.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>By the time they reached the house the luau was done to a turn and the tables were
spread. Wahine-oma&#x2019;o made an oblation to the gods and then ate of the viands. Hiiaka
did not partake of the food.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka now spent several days at Hono-kane, in Kohala, anxiously awaiting the departure
of some canoe, by which she might pass over to the island of Maui. While thus absorbed,
in a sentimental mood, looking one day across the ocean at the misty outline of the
distant land, she saw a man of remarkable appearance strike out from one headland
of the bay to swim to the opposite point. Her admiration for his physical beauty and
his daring performance drew from her a song:

</p>
<p>As they sat at a feast spread in her honor, Hiiaka, as was her wont, bowed her head
in prayer with closed eyes, and the others did likewise and when they opened their
eyes and looked, the portion that had been set before Hiiaka was gone, spirited away.
</p>
<p>In the evening it was announced that a canoe was to sail in the early morning on a
voyage to Maui, whereupon Hiiaka secured the promise of a passage for herself and
Wahine-oma&#x2019;o.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE VOYAGE TO MAUI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s voyage across the Ale-nui-haha channel, considered merely as a sea adventure,
was a tame experience. There was no storm, no boistrous weather, sea as calm as a
mill-pond, nothing to fillip the imagination with a sense of excitement or danger;
yet it was far from being an agreeable experience to the young woman who was now having
her first hand-to-hand tussle with the world.
</p>
<p>They had spent the night at the house of one Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-nui. In the early morning their
host and a younger man&#x2014;apparently his son&#x2014;named Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-iki, made ready their canoe
to sail for Maui. Hiiaka, assuming that passage would be granted both of them, in
accordance with a promise made the previous day, stood ready against the hour of departure.
At the last moment, the younger man, having assisted Wahine-oma&#x2019;o to her seat in the
bow next to himself, called to his elder, &#x201c;Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-nui, why don&#x2019;t you show your
passenger to her seat, the one next you?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-nui answered groutily. &#x201c;I find that the canoe will be overloaded
if we take passengers aboard and all our landlord&#x2019;s freight will get wet.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The real reason for this <i>volte-face</i> on the part of the old sailor was that he had made an unseemly proposition to Hiiaka
the night before and she had repelled him.
</p>
<p>Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, thereupon, left her seat and the canoe started without them. It was
not more than fairly underway, however, when a violent sea struck the craft and swamped
it, and all the loose freight was floating about in the ocean.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;There, you see! We&#x2019;d &#x2019;ave had better luck with the women aboard.&#x201d; Such was the exclamation
of Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-iki.
</p>
<p>It did not take long to convince the old man Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-nui, who was captain of the
canoe, that he had invited this disaster on himself, the agent of which, as he rightly
suspected, was none other than the distinguished-looking young woman who now stood
on the beach watching him in his predicament with unperturbed countenance.
</p>
<p>The two men floated their canoe, collected their baggage and came ashore. When they
had got the stuff dry and stowed in the waist of the craft, they escorted the women
aboard, seating Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, as directed by the captain, in the bow near Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-iki
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>and Hiiaka in the after part, within arm&#x2019;s length of Pi&#x2019;i-ke-a-nui, and they put to
sea.
</p>
<p>The canoe was a small affair, unprovided with that central platform, the pola, that
might serve as the cabin or quarter deck, on which the passengers could stretch themselves
for comfort. In her weariness, Hiiaka, with her head toward the bow, reclined her
body against the top rail of the canoe, thus eking out the insufficiency of the narrow
thwart that was her seat; and she fell asleep, or rather, entered that border-land
of Nod, in which the central watchman has not yet given over control of the muscular
system and the ear still maintains its aerial reconnoissance.
</p>
<p>The wind, meanwhile, as it caromed aft from the triangular sail of mat, coquetted
with her tropical apparel and made paú and kihei shake like summer leaves.
</p>
<p>The steersman, in whom that precious factor, a chivalrous regard for woman, was even
of less value than is common to the savage breast, in the pursuit of a fixed purpose,
began to direct amorous glances at the prostrate form before him and to the neglect
of his own proper duties. Presently he left his steering and stole up to Hiiaka with
privy paw outstretched. Hiiaka roused from her half-dreamy state on the instant, and
the man sprang back and resumed his paddle.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, with the utmost coolness, expressed in song her remonstrance and sarcastic
rebuke for this exhibition of inhospitable rudeness:

He hasn&#x2019;t the decency to wait till he gets ashore.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In the midst of this unpleasantness it was a comfort to hear the strong cheerful voice
of her former companion Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e calling to her across the stretch of waters.
It will be remembered that their roads had parted company sometime before Hiiaka had
left the big island. The separation had made no change, however, in their mutual affection:

the village as to the whereabouts of the two young women who had just now landed as
passengers from the canoe, they one and all denied having set eyes upon them.

<p>Hiiaka had planned a visit with her sister Kapo; but, on reaching Wailuku, the house
was empty; Kapo and her husband Pua-nui had but just started to make a ceremonious
call on Ole-pau, a famous chief of the district. The receding figure of Kapo was already

<p class="first">As Hiiaka passed along the cliff that overlooks the wave-swept beach at Hono-lua,
a pitiful sight met her eye, the figure of a woman crippled from birth&#x2014;without hands.
Yet, in spite of her maimed condition, the brave spirit busied herself gathering shell-fish;
and when a tumbling wave rolled across the beach she made herself a partner in its
sport and gleefully retreated, skipping and dancing to the words of a song:

<p class="first">Search for the hidden meaning of this oli has brought out a marvellous diversity of
opinion. The chief difficulty lies in the interpretation of the second verse: <i lang="haw">Ka i&#x2019;a kahiko pu no me ka wahine</i>, and centers in the expression <i lang="haw">kahiko pu</i>. One able critic finds in it an allusion to the coöperation of women with the men
in the work of fishing. <i lang="haw">Kahiko</i> is a word of dignity meaning finely apparelled. The addition of the preposition <i lang="haw">pu</i> amplifies it and gives it almost the meaning of wrapped together. It seems probable
also that the word <i lang="haw">i&#x2019;a</i>, literally fish, is to be taken in an esoteric sense as a euphemism for man. Putting
this interpretation upon it, the meaning of the expression <i lang="haw">kahiko pu</i> becomes clear as being wrapped together, as in the sexual embrace.
</p>
<p>Wahine-oma&#x2019;o was greatly fascinated by the pathos and romance of the situation and

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA RESTORES TO LIFE MANA-MANA-IA-KALU-EA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As they drew near Wailuku, they crossed a sandy plain dotted with tumuli. At once
the captive spirit of Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea became restless, as if eager to be free.
&#x201c;We are nearing the place where rests its body,&#x201d; explained Hiiaka. Wahine-oma&#x2019;o by
soft words and gentle touch did her best to soothe the perturbed thing.
</p>
<p>It might almost be said that the captive spirit of Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea was the guide
(acting like the magnetic needle to point the way) to the home where the as-yet uncorrupted
body of the girl still lay, mourned over by her parents<span class="corr" id="xd29e3172" title="Source: ..">.</span>
</p>
<p>It was with much prayer and the use of persuasive force that Hiiaka compelled the
seemingly reluctant spirit to reenter its bodily tenement and to take up its abode
there. As it passed from its point of entrance at the toe up into the chest its progress
was marked by a kindling warmth that gave the assurance that the spirit was resuming
its empiry over the whole body.
</p>
<p>The first request made by the girl, on regaining full consciousness, was that her
parents would prepare a feast as a thank-offering to Hiiaka, her physician, her deliverer.
The special articles on which she was most insistent were luau and baked <i lang="haw">aoaoa</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e3181src" href="#xd29e3181">1</a>
</p>
<p>When it came to the final dressing of the luau for the table, namely the stripping
off of the outer leafy covering from the scalding hot mass within&#x2014;an operation which
the girl insisted on doing with her own newly restored hands&#x2014;Hiiaka watched her critically;
for the proper etiquette of the function was most punctilious. But Hiiaka could find
no fault with her technique: there was no slip, no solecism, no blowing on her fingers
to relieve the scalding heat, as she stripped off the wrappings of the bundles.
</p>
<p>When the feast was set and all were gathered about the tables, at Hiiaka&#x2019;s command
all bowed their heads with closed eyes and she offered up her prayer to the gods of
heaven. At the conclusion of her prayer, when they looked, lo, the portion of the
feast set apart for the gods had vanished without leaving a trace <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>behind. On this occasion Hiiaka was seen to eat of the food that was provided for
her.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e3191src" href="#xd29e3191">2</a>
</p>
<p>The line of travel now chosen by Hiiaka was that along the northern or Koolau side
of the island of Maui and led them at first through a barren stretch of country called
a kaha, the food-supply of which came from a distance. It was here that Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
began to complain bitterly of hunger and exhaustion from the lack of food, and she
besought Hiiaka to intercede with the people of a neighboring fishing village to give
them <span class="corr" id="xd29e3205" title="Source: somethnig">something</span> to eat.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;How is this, that you are a-hungered so soon after the feast of which you have partaken?
This is a kaha,&#x201d; said Hiiaka, &#x201c;and you must know that food does not grow in this place.
They have only fish from the sea. Nevertheless, I will venture the request.&#x201d; This
she did in the language of song:
</p>

<p class="first">Some of the people derided them, saying, &#x201c;Mahaoi!&#x201d;&#x2014;what impudence! Others, with kindness
in their tones, explained, &#x201c;This is a barren place; and all of our food comes from
a great distance.&#x201d; The churlish ones, however, kept up their taunts: &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t get
any food in this place. Go up there;&#x201d; and they pointed in the direction of Iao valley,
where was the residence of King Ole-pau.
</p>
<p>During the whole of the day, while tramping through this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>region, Hiiaka had observed from time to time a ghostly object flitting across the
plain within hearing distance and in a direction parallel to their course. Though
this spirit was not visible to ordinary mortal eye, Hiiaka recognized it as the second
soul of Ole-pau, the very chief to whom the people of the fishing village had bid
her make her appeal for food. Hiiaka, putting two and two together, very naturally
came to the conclusion that this vagrant <i lang="haw">kino wailua</i> was, in the last resort, responsible for this denial of hospitality to herself and
her companion. Acting on this conclusion, Hiiaka made a captive of the vagrant soul
and determined to hold it as a hostage for the satisfaction of her reasonable demands.
</p>
<p>On coming within speaking distance of the house where lived the woman Wai-hinano,
who ostentatiously played the part of kahu and chief adviser to Ole-pau, Hiiaka made
known her wish, concluding her appeal with ominous threats against the life of the
king, in case her demands were not met:

<p>After each incantation that Hiiaka had uttered against Ka-ula-hea that king&#x2019;s disorder
had flared up in more alarming proportions, and he cried out in agony and despair.
But it was equally true that just as often as Wai-hinano had uttered her assurances
that his trouble was but a trivial indisposition and that the male and female deities&#x2014;above
named&#x2014;stood on his side and would not let him die, his courage had revived, he had
felt a wave of healing influence pass through him and relief had come.
</p>
<p>In explanation of this see-saw of hope and despair, sickness and relief, let it be
stated that the two goddesses Ha-pu&#x2019;u and Ka-lei-hau-ola and the two male deities
Ke-olo-ewa and Kama-ua, to whom Wai-hinano had appealed by name as staunch friends
of Ka-ula-hea, were, in fact, allies, or, more properly speaking, partizans of Pele
and, therefore, subject to the call of Hiiaka. The kahuna Kaua-kahi-ma-hiku-lani who
had charge of the case of Ka-ula-hea derived his power as a kahuna from these very
same gods; but he well knew that if there was a conflict of interests the commands
of Hiiaka would have to be carried out. As for the gods and goddesses above named,
they, of course, knew their own position and that, as between Ka-ula-hea and Hiiaka,
their service must be rendered to the latter. Willing enough they were, however, in
return for the offerings laid on their altars, to feed the hopes of the sick man by
temporary relief of his sharpest agonies.
</p>
<p>As if this tangle of motives were not enough, the affair was yet further complicated
by the appearance of Kapo&#x2014;sister, or aunt of Hiiaka&#x2014;on the scene, who came not only
as an interested spectator but as a friend of king Ka-ula-hea. Her power to intervene
was, of course, handicapped by the same limitations that touched the other gods and
goddesses. She had the good sense to retire from the scene before things came to a
critical pass.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile messengers are flying about, seeking or bringing assurance of relief and
restoration to health to the king. Hiiaka saw that the time had come for decisive
action. She went close up to the great stone Paha-lele that still lies in the road
near Wai-he&#x2019;e and, before smiting against the rock the soul she held captive in her
hand, she uttered the following kau:

Wahine-oma&#x2019;o into the shape of a little girl leading a dog, while she herself assumed
the form of a bent old woman hobbling along with the aid of a stick; and as the multitude
drew near they sat down by the wayside as if to rest.
</p>
<p>The people in pursuit had seen and recognized Hiiaka and felt sure of soon overtaking
her. But, on coming to the place, they found only a decrepit woman and a child leading
a dog. They were taken aback and asked, &#x201c;Where are the two young women who were traveling
this way? Have you not seen them?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;We have seen nothing of them,&#x201d; was the answer.
</p>
<p>When the people reported to the kahuna that they had found only an old woman and a
girl with a dog in tow, he saw through the trick at once and exclaimed, &#x201c;Those are
the very persons I want. Go and bring them.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The messengers of the kahuna next came up with Hiiaka and her companion at a place
called Ka-lau-la&#x2019;ola&#x2019;o. There they found two girls of tender age busily employed in
gathering lehua flowers and stringing them into wreaths; and, as before, they denied
all sight and knowledge of the persons inquired for. The kahuna recognized that his
people had again been victimized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>and, upbraiding them for their lack of detective insight, ordered them to renew the
pursuit.
</p>
<p>Once more, at Kapua, in Ka-ana-pali, did Hiiaka find it necessary to resort to the
arts of magic in order to escape from her pursuers. When the scouts of the kahuna
arrived at the place they found a household of busy women&#x2014;a wrinkled matronly figure
was braiding a mat, while her companion, just returned from the ocean, was laying
a fire to broil a fish for the evening meal. Not until they had gone some distance
from the place did it occur to their sharpening wits that the house had looked spick-and-span
new, and that they had seen no <i>man</i> about the place. Yes&#x2014;they had been fooled again by the wonderful art of the girl
Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka was rejoiced to find a canoe on the point of sailing to Moloka&#x2019;i and the sailors
gladly consented to give her a passage. The people of Kapua were greatly taken with
the beauty and charm of Hiiaka and proposed, in all seriousness, that she should remain
and become one of them. When they found that she was insistent to continue her journey
at once, they one and all warned her not to attempt the windward side of <span class="corr" id="xd29e3594" title="Source: Molokai">Moloka&#x2019;i</span>, declaring its coast to be precipitous and impassable, besides being infested by
a band of man-killing mo&#x2019;o.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka had no sooner set foot on Molokai&#x2019;s beach than her ears were assailed with
complaints against those lawless beings, the mo&#x2019;o. Two women, pallid and wasted with
starvation, sat in the open field moaning and bewailing their estate. At sight of
Hiiaka, as if recognizing their knight errant, they broke out into loud lamentations.
The mo&#x2019;o had robbed them of their husbands, and with them had gone their means of
support and their very desire for food. Hiiaka, as if recognizing their claim upon
her knight-errantry, with heartfelt sympathy for their miserable condition, opened
her mouth in song:

<p>Hiiaka was indignant at such folly and left them to their fate. Their way still continued
for some distance through a barren region and Hiiaka again alluded in song to the
barrenness of the land and the misery of the women who suffered their bodies to waste
away:

</div>
<p class="first">The good people of Halawa valley, where Hiiaka found herself well received, made earnest
protest against the madness of her determination to make her way along the precipitous
coast wall that formed <span class="corr" id="xd29e3634" title="Source: Molokai&#x2019;s">Moloka&#x2019;i&#x2019;s</span> windward rampart. The route, they said, was impassable. Its overhanging cliffs, where
nested the tropic-bird and the ua&#x2019;u, dropped the plummet straight into the boiling
ocean. Equally to be dreaded was a nest of demonlike creatures, mo&#x2019;o, that infested
the region and had their headquarters at Kiki-pua, which gave name to the chief mo&#x2019;o.
Kiki-pua, being of the female sex, generally chose the form of a woman as a disguise
to her character which combined the fierceness and blood-thirstiness of the serpent
with the shifty resources of witchcraft, thus enabling her to assume a great variety
of physical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>shapes, as suited her purpose. This last fact, had it stood by itself, would have
decided Hiiaka&#x2019;s choice; for her journey, considered as a pilgrimage, had as an important
side-purpose the extermination root-and-branch, of the whole cursed tribe of mo&#x2019;o
from one end of the land to the other.
</p>
<p>(This Kiki-pua band of mo&#x2019;o had included Haka-a&#x2019;ano, the husband of Kiki-pua, also
Papala-ua and her husband Oloku&#x2019;i.<a class="noteref" id="xd29e3641src" href="#xd29e3641">1</a> Kiki-pua had stolen away and taken to herself Oloku&#x2019;i, the husband of Papala-ua,
thus creating a bitter feud which broke up the solidarity of the band.)
</p>
<p>The way chosen by Hiiaka led along the precipitous face of the mountain by a trail
that offered at the best only a precarious foothold or clutch for the hand. At one
place a clean break opened sheer and straight into the boiling sea. As they contemplated
this <i>impasse</i>, a plank, narrow and tenuous, seemed to bridge the abyss. Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, rejoicing
at the way thus offered, promptly essayed to set foot upon it, thinking thus to make
the passage. Hiiaka held her back, and on the instant the bridgelike structure vanished.
It was the tongue of the mo&#x2019;o thrust out in imitation of a plank, a device to lure
Hiiaka and her companion to their destruction.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, not to be outdone as a wonder-worker, spanned the abyss by stretching across
it her own magical pa-ú, and over this, as on a bridge, she and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o passed
in security.
</p>
<p>The mo&#x2019;o, Kiki-pua, took flight and hid among the cavernous rocks. But that did not
avail for safety. Hiiaka gave chase and, having caught her, put an end to the life
of the miserable creature. Thus did Hiiaka take another step towards ridding the land
of the mo&#x2019;o.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s adventurous tour of Moloka&#x2019;i ended at Kauna-ka-kai, from which place she
found no difficulty in obtaining the offer of transportation to Oahu. The real embarrassment
lay in the super-gallantry of the two sailors who manned the canoe. When the two men
looked upon Hiiaka and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, they were so taken with admiration for their
beauty and attractiveness, that they sneaked out of a previous engagement to take
their own wives along with them, trumping up some shuffling excuse about the canoe
being overladen.
</p>
<p>Arriving at the desolate landing near the wild promontory of Maka-pu&#x2019;u, it was only
by a piece of well-timed duplicity that Hiiaka and her companion managed to shake
off the sailors and relieve themselves from their excessive attentions.
</p>
<p>While in mid channel, in sight of Ulu-ma-wao, a promontory whose name was the same
as a near relative of the Pele family, Hiiaka poured out this reminiscence in song:

<p class="first">It was a question with Hiiaka whether to follow the Koolau or the Kona side of the
island. The consideration that turned the scale in favor of the Koolau route was that
thus she would have sight of a large number of aunts and uncles, members of the Pele
family, whose ghosts still clung to the dead volcanic cones and headlands which stood
as relics of their bygone activities, and where they eked out a miserable existence.
The region was thickly strewn with these skeleton forms. Hiiaka first addressed herself
to Maka-pu&#x2019;u:

<p id="note88" class="note54"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&#x2014;Malei was, I am told, a female kupua who assumed various bodily forms. Offerings
were necessary, not for her physical but for her spiritual sustenance. The burnt offering
was not merely pleasing for its sweet smelling savour, it was an <span class="corr" id="xd29e3779" title="Source: ailment">aliment</span> necessary to the creature&#x2019;s continued existence. For the same or a parallel reason,
songs of praise and adulation (kanaenae) were equally acceptable and equally efficacious.
Cut off the flowers of speech as well as the offerings of its worshippers, and a kupua
would soon dwindle into nothingness.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;You are quite right,&#x201d; answered Malei: &#x201c;the only food to be had in this desolate spot
is the herbage that grows hereabouts; and for clothing we have to put up with such
clouts as are tossed us by travelers. When the wind blows one has but to open his
mouth to get his belly full. That has been our plight since your sister left us two
old people here. Cultivate this plain, you say; plant it with sweet potatoes; see
the leaves cover the hills; then make an oven and so relieve your hunger. Impossible.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>As they traveled on Maka-pu&#x2019;u and its neighbor hills passed out of sight. Arriving
at Ka-ala-pueo, they caught view of the desolate hill Pohaku-loa, faint, famished,
forlorn. The sight of it drew from Hiiaka this chanting utterance:

<p>To speak again of the kupua Malei, a few years ago, as I am told, a Hawaiian woman

a stone figure, from which glowed like burning coals a group of eight flaming eyes,
being set in deep sockets in the stone. This rare object was soon recognized as the

Squalls, heavy with rain-drops picked up by the wind in its passage across the broad

were her encounters with that outlaw thing, the mo&#x2019;o; not the bold robber creature
of Hawaii which took to the wilds, as if in recognition of its own outlawry, but that
meaner skulk, whose degenerate spirit had parted with its last atom of virtuous courage

With a mighty effort he lifted himself and tore away the covering of tree-roots, earth

of his power: he could do no more. A stony form in the mountain wall of Kahana, resembling
the shape of a man on all-fours, remains to vouch for the truth of this legend.

of worship, or as an offering to the gods. This began with the very digging of the
awa root. He who did this had first to purify himself by a bath in the ocean, followed
by an ablution in fresh water and completing the lustration with an aspersion of water
containing turmeric, administered by a priest. Then, having arrayed himself in a clean
malo, he knelt with both knees upon the ground and tore the root from its bed. Now,
rising to his feet, he lifted the awa root to heaven, and by this act the awa was
dignified and was called <i lang="haw">awa i-ku</i>. The utterance (by the priest?) of the kanaenae, or prayer of consecration and eulogy,
still further enhanced this dignity and set it apart as a special sacrifice to some
god, or to the gods of some class. Awa thus consecrated was known as <i lang="haw">awa i-lani</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n116asrc">&#x2191;</a></p>

the crouching figures of Punahe&#x2019;e-lapa and Pahi-pahi-alua, who stole away into the

<p class="first">They crossed the Waimea stream on the sand-bar, which in ordinary weather dams its
mouth and, climbing the rocky bluff Kehu-o-hapu&#x2019;u, had a fine view of the ocean surges
tossing up their white spray as they ceaselessly beat against the near-by elevated
reef-fringe that parapets this coast, as well as of the Ka-ala mountains, blue in
the distance.
</p>
<p>(This bluff of Kehu-o-hapu&#x2019;u until within a few years was the site of a little heiau,
the resort of fishermen; and in it stood a rude stone figure of the fish-god Ku-ula.
From the non-mention of this interesting object, we have to argue either that the
discovery and worship of this idol was of later date than the times of Hiiaka or that
she ignored it.)
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, casting her eye about for objects of interest, was attracted by the odd appearance
of the lily-like water-plant uki, the detached floating clumps of which looked as

<p class="first">The story of Cape Ka-ena, that finger-like thrusts itself out into the ocean from
the western extremity of Oahu, touches Hawaiian mythology at many points: Its mountain
eminence was a <i lang="haw">leina uhane</i>, jumping-off place, where the spirits of the deceased took their flying leap into
ghost-land. Here it was that the demigod Mawi had his <i lang="haw">pou sto</i> when he made the supreme effort of his life to align and unite the scattered group
of islands; and here can still be seen Pohaku o Kauai, the one fragment of <i>terra firma</i> his hook could wrench from its base. Here, too, it was that Pele stood when she chaffed
the old demi-god for having lured her on, as she supposed, with drum and fife to the
pursuit of Lohiau; and now her sister Hiiaka stands in the same place. The subject
was well worthy Hiiaka&#x2019;s muse:

his station at Kaena Point, the western extremity of Oahu, from which the island of

far out into the ocean that it might engage itself in the foundations of Kaua&#x2019;i. When
he felt that it had taken a good hold, he gave a mighty tug at the line. A huge bowlder,
the Pohaku o Kaua&#x2019;i, fell at his feet. The mystic hook, having freed itself from its
entanglement, dropped into Palolo Valley and hollowed out the crater, that is its
grave. This failure to move the whole mass of the island argues no engineering miscalculation
on Mawi&#x2019;s part. It was due to the underhand working of spiritual forces. Had Mawi
been more politic, more observant of spiritual etiquette, more diplomatic in his dealings
with the heavenly powers, his ambitious plans would, no doubt, have met with better

<p class="first">Hiiaka had large acquaintance with the natural features of every landscape, and if
those features were of volcanic origin she might claim them as kindred through her
own relationship with Pele. It was hers to find friendship, if not sermons, in stones.
This Pohaku-o-Kaua&#x2019;i, to whom Hiiaka now addressed herself, though in outward form
an unshapen bowlder, as we see it today,&#x2014;the very one that Mawi drew from its ocean-bed
with his magic hook Mana-ia-ka-lani&#x2014;was in truth a sentient being, alive to all the
honor-claims of kinship. To him, in her need, Hiiaka addressed herself:

aboard and split her from end to end. We had to swim for it. But surely, such a beautiful
woman as you will have no trouble in finding a canoe. There must be no lack of canoes
making the trip to Kaua&#x2019;i.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;In the lack of a canoe, let us have a plank, such as I see you are there using for
a shelf.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;If that will serve you, you are welcome,&#x201d; said the old man.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;We shall also need an outrigger-float for our craft,&#x201d; Hiiaka remarked.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;An ama (outrigger-float) is a thing I lack,&#x201d; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You must have some block of wili-wili&#x2014;such as that one, for instance, <span class="corr" id="xd29e4682" title="Source: wihch">which</span> you use to hold your fishhooks,&#x201d; <span class="corr" id="xd29e4685" title="Source: Hiaaka">Hiiaka</span> urged.
</p>
<p>The old man was able to meet their demands. The two women then set their wits to work
and finally succeeded in lashing the parts together in such fashion as to make something
that would serve as a canoe.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, as the one in command, sat astern and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o in the bow. As they sailed
away <span class="corr" id="xd29e4691" title="Source: Hiaaka">Hiiaka</span> saluted Cape Ka-ena in these words:

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On arriving at Haena, Hiiaka did not go at once to Lohiau&#x2019;s place but to the house
of Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa, a man of chiefish rank, and one who had the reputation of being
a seer. He was lame and unable to walk. For this reason his wife, Wailua-nui-a-hoano,
had carried him down to the seashore and, leaving him there to his fishing, had gone
home to her work of tapa-making. She was busily wielding the tapa club in the <i lang="haw">hale kuku kapa</i> while Hiiaka stood outside the enclosure and sang:

<p>The woman Wai-lua-nui-a-hoano received in silence this sharp reproof of her haughty
and inhospitable conduct, couched, though it was, in the veiled language of symbol.
Her eyes left the work in hand and followed Hiiaka and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o as they turned
and faced the path that climbed the pali wall.
</p>
<p>Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa, lame, guileless, innocent of all transgression, meanwhile, sat and
fished. He had cast afresh his triple-hooked line, blown from his mouth into the water
the comminuted fragments of the shrimps whose bodies baited his hooks and, as he waited
for a bite he chanted a song (to the god of good luck) that reached Hiiaka&#x2019;s ear:
</p>
<div id="lg110.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pa mai ka makani o ka lele wa&#x2019;a, e:
</p>
<p class="line">Makani kai ehu lalo o ka pali o Ki-pú.

<div id="lg110.4" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I hail thee, Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa,
</p>
<p class="line">Thou fisherman of the cliffs.
</p>
<p class="line">As a youth you fished at Wai-niha;
</p>
<p class="line">Grandson thou to Ka-noa-lani,
</p>
<p class="line">Fishing now &#x2019;neath the bluffs of Haena,

<p class="line">Sometime breasting the steep mountain ladder.

<p class="line">Send fish, O Heaven, to this fisherman;
</p>
<p class="line">Send fish to Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As if obedient to the charm of Hiiaka&#x2019;s incantation, the breeze sank to a whisper
and the ruffled surface of the ocean took on a calm that brought fish to the fisherman&#x2019;s
hooks.
</p>
<p>Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa looked up from his work and, though he did not recognize Hiiaka, he
had an intuitive sense that it was her power that had quieted the elements and, with
a shrewd insight, he divined that she was of the Pele family. &#x201c;It is you then that
has made this day one of calm;&#x201d; and he continued his address in song:
</p>
<div id="lg111.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">

</p>
<p class="line">Fish for the godlike woman of Puna.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa felt a genial thrill pervading his system; new vigor came to him; he
found himself able to stand on his feet and walk. Some new and wonderful power had
come into his life. In the first flush of his ecstacy, he gathered up his fishing
tackle, thrust the hooks and lines into his basket and walked triumphantly home on
his own feet. Without a word to his wife, he began to tear down a portion of the fence
that enclosed the house-lot.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What are you about?&#x201d; exclaimed his wife; &#x201c;tearing down our fence!&#x2026; But what has happened
to you? Here you are for the first time in many years able to walk on your feet!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The man made no immediate reply, but kept on with his work. When she repeated her
questionings and expressions of wonder, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>he quietly asked, &#x201c;Have you not seen two women about the place?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;There were two women who came this way,&#x201d; she answered thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Would you think it! They were divine beings,&#x201d; he exclaimed in a tone of conviction.
&#x201c;We must spread for them a feast. You had better prepare some luau.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa himself, alii as he was, with his own hands set about dressing and
preparing a dog for the oven. This was his own token of service. At his command his
people brought the material for an abundant feast.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka saw from a distance the smoke of Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa&#x2019;s imu and recognized the bustle
preparatory to a feast, she exclaimed to her companion, &#x201c;The lame man has saved the
day.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>When the repast was nearing its end and the people had well eaten, Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa
and his wife stood forth and led in the performance of a sacred dance, accompanying
their rhythmic motions with a long mele that recited the deeds, the events, the mysteries
that had marked Pele&#x2019;s reign since the establishment of her dominion in Hawaii:

<p class="first">With a nice feeling of etiquette, <span class="corr" id="xd29e6334" title="Source: Hiaaka&#x2019;s">Hiiaka&#x2019;s</span> hosts allowed the day of her arrival to pass with no inquiry as to the purpose of
her visit. But on the morning of the morrow Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa asked the question that
put himself in sympathetic touch with his guests.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I have come to escort Lohiau as a lover to the bed of Pele,&#x201d; said Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Lohiau has been dead many days,&#x201d; they both exclaimed. &#x201c;He took his own life out of
a passionate infatuation for one of <span class="corr" id="xd29e6340" title="Source: the the">the</span> Hono-pú<a class="noteref" id="xd29e6343src" href="#xd29e6343">1</a> women.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Let that be as it may,&#x201d; Hiiaka answered; &#x201c;I will go and see for myself.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Now Kahua-nui, the sister of Lohiau, had laid his body to rest in a sepulcher close
to her own residence; but on examination the place was found to be empty. It was evident
that the body had been spirited away. Hiiaka, turning her gaze to the mountain, discerned
a ghostly form standing at the mouth of a cave. It was the ghost of Lohiau. In an
effort to soothe and attract him, Hiiaka, with arms extended and face uplifted, in
passionate utterance gave vent to her emotions:

<p>Again she scanned the lineaments of the shadowy form if she might find there the picture
her mind had imaged. At second view, the ghostly unreality of the tenuous image so
greatly shocked her imagination by its contrast to her ideal of a true flesh-and-blood
lover, that she amended her first utterance:

&#x201c;It is evident you loved my brother, that handsome fellow&#x2014;dead! If only the woman
had been like you! What a pity that he should have wasted himself on such a good-for-nothing!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Tell me, pray, where did you lay your brother&#x2019;s body?&#x201d; asked Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yonder,&#x201d; said she, pointing to a grass house. &#x201c;Lima-loa, who hails from Kauna-lewa,
in Mana, bound on the thatch. That job completed, he went away with all the men of
the place to bewail him. We two women alone remain to keep watch over him. There he
lies and we stand guard over his sepulcher.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Then Hiiaka, girding herself with her divine attributes as a goddess of Kilauea&#x2014;the
power which, on occasion, availed to flood the plains of Puna with sounding plates
of pahoehoe, or to heap up the rugged aä at Maukele&#x2014;reached into the sepulcher in
search of Lohiau&#x2019;s body. But it was not there. It had been stolen away by the two
mo&#x2019;o-witches (Kilioe and Ka-lana-mai-nu&#x2019;u) and lodged in a cave high up in the inaccessible
mountain side.

<p class="first">Hiiaka, at the mention of Lima-loa and the part he had taken in constructing the house
that served as a sepulcher for Lohiau, jumped to the conclusion that he had been the
body-snatcher of Lohiau. Kahuanui strongly dissented from this view. &#x201c;There can be
no doubt,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;that my brother&#x2019;s body lies in that sepulcher at this very moment.
That is the reason for my keeping guard over the place. But why stand we here? Let
us go to my home.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>As Hiiaka went with her she again had sight of the ghost-form of Lohiau standing in
the door of the cavern, and she addressed to him this mele:

<p class="first">Hiiaka now perceived two female figures squatted at the entrance of the cavern, which
they had carefully blocked and were guarding. These were the creatures that had stolen
away the body of Lohiau. She at once raised her voice and addressed them with this
threatening language:

<p class="first">The magic of these words worked their death-purpose. The way to the sepulchral cave
was now unobstructed. As they came, however, to the base of the cliff, they found

</p>
<p>The girl did so and used her best efforts to climb the mountain wall. The day was
far spent and darkness would soon come on. Thereupon Hiiaka invoked the Sun, bidding
it stand still at the mouth of the river Hea:

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA UTTERS MANY PRAYERS TO RESTORE LOHIAU TO LIFE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before proceeding to her task Hiiaka instructed Malae ha&#x2019;a-koa to call in the guards
stationed at Lohiau&#x2019;s sepulcher and to keep the hula going for the next ten days as
an attraction to draw off the people from playing the spy on her performances.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka and her companion conquered the impossible and scaled the mountain wall as
if their feet had the clinging property of the fly. Lohiau&#x2019;s ghost would have escaped,
but with birdlike quickness she caught it. At her command Wahine-oma&#x2019;o gathered certain
aromatic and fragrant herbs of the wilderness, and having made a fire, they bruised
and warmed the <span class="corr" id="xd29e6644" title="Source: simples">samples</span> and spread them upon a sheet of leaves.
</p>
<p>While Wahine-oma&#x2019;o kept fast hold of the feet, Hiiaka forced the soul-particle to
pass in through one of the eye-sockets. It went as far as the cavity of the chest,
then turned back and strove to escape. Hiiaka guarded the ways of exit and with skillful
manipulations compelled it to go on. Reaching the loins, it balked again; but Hiiaka&#x2019;s
art conquered its resistance and the human particle extended its journey to the feet.
There was a twitching of these parts; the hands began to move, the eye-lids to quiver;
breath once more entered the body. They lifted and laid it on the blanket of aromatics
and restoratives, swathing it from head to foot.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka set a calabash of water before her and, addressing Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, said, &#x201c;Listen
to my prayer. If it is correct and faultless, our man will live; but if it is wrong
or imperfect, he will die.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;He will not survive,&#x201d; replied Wahine-oma&#x2019;o gloomily.

stand-point of view, the prayer seemed short.

<p class="first">The conclusion of this prayer saw Lohiau quite restored to consciousness, but in a
state of utter bewilderment as to his surroundings. He found himself most unaccountably
in a small rocky chamber with two women who were utter strangers in attendance on
him. Before him, as he looked out, hung the apron of a mountain precipice, while in
the distance and far below tossed the ocean, a familiar sight that called him back
to earth at once, stirring pleasant fancies in his mind and waking in him a yearning
for the sea.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THEY DESCEND FROM THE CLIFF BY RAINBOW BRIDGES&#x2014;LOHIAU, RESTORED, GOES A-SURFING</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s work of healing was now accomplished. She had seen the cold and withered
form gain fullness, warmth and color; been cheered by the oö-a-moa, the crowing sigh
that came with the inrush of air to the lungs&#x2014;and now he stood before her in physical
perfection.
</p>
<p>The question&#x2014;asked by Wahine-oma&#x2019;o&#x2014;how they were to climb down from their inaccessible
position was answered by the sudden appearance of three rainbows that arched themselves
conveniently at their feet, and on these, as on ladders, they climbed from the dizzy
height to the sleeping village below. Under the priestly guidance of Hiiaka, they
all now resorted to the ocean and with the aid of its waters performed the rite of
cleansing from the ceremonial defilement that came from the touch of a corpse. With
this cleansing each one of them seemed to have a new birth of physical perfection.
As they came up out of the water their bodies seemed actually to glow with a fresh
and radiant beauty.
</p>
<p>The touch of salt water woke in Lohiau a longing he could not resist. He took his
surf-board and, with face to the incoming rollers, made for the open sea. The place
was one where he had often sported before, prescriptive custom having in fact set
it apart for the exclusive use of the chiefs.
</p>
<p>The &#x201c;fish&#x201d;&#x2014;as the Hawaiians called the Milky way&#x2014;was already declining in the west
and beginning to pale at the approach of a new day, and Lohiau still rode the waves.
</p>
<p>That same night Kahua-nui, Lohiau&#x2019;s sister, woke from her sleep with a start. She
went out of doors and, lifting her eyes to the mountain wall, saw a light gleaming
in the cave where lay her brother&#x2019;s body. She rubbed her eyes to remove the cobwebs
of sleep&#x2014;yes, there it was, a quivering light, set like an eye in the socket of the
mountain wall, and figures moving about. She rushed back into the house where slept
her husband and stirred him with her foot.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What are you about!&#x201d; demanded the man. &#x201c;Do you want to kill me?&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>&#x201c;Get up; there&#x2019;s a fire burning in the cave, up the mountain. Come!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What crazy fit possesses you,&#x201d; muttered the man as he went out. &#x201c;To knock my wind
out with such a kick!&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s no fire up there, merely a star sinking in the west.
That&#x2019;s all there was to it. Go to bed!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The woman was silenced but not convinced. Her sleep continued to be broken. She fancied
that she heard a human voice calling to her; yet, on listening, she could distinguish
only the moaning of the surf. In her restlessness she wandered forth again and stood
in the cool vault of night. The endless monotone of the ocean filled her ears, but
it told her nothing new. She sought her bed again and turned her face to the mat in
a resolute effort to sleep. She dozed, but the subtle goddess evaded her. Thoughts
of her brother floated through her mind, and the booming of the surf now seemed to
assume a more intimate tone and by some witchery of the imagination led her out under
the winking stars, closer to old Ocean&#x2019;s moan, and made her think: how Lohiau did
delight in the surf; what pleasure he took in riding the billows! Thus she murmured
to herself. At that moment her straining vision detected an object moving with the
waves. &#x201c;Some man surfing in our tabu waters&#x2014;yet how can that be? Have not all the
men of the village gone over to Niihau? Paoa urged them to go.&#x201d; She moved along the
beach. By this time it was dawn.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;There comes a woman,&#x201d; said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;His sister, Kahua-nui,&#x201d; Hiiaka remarked quietly.
</p>
<p>Wahine-oma&#x2019;o called to her by name and went forward to meet her.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Ah, it is you two women,&#x201d; Kahua-nui exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your husband?&#x201d; Wahine-oma&#x2019;o asked.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Asleep in the house.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Go and call him; tell him to take his canoe and go over to Niihau and bring Paoa,&#x201d;
said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o. &#x201c;Lohiau is alive and well. Look, there he comes on the surf-board.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In a tumult of joy the woman ran to the house and shouted the tidings to her husband.
Nakoa-ola, girding his malo about him as he came out of the door, made all speed for
the halau; shoved the canoe down the slope of the beach; looked to the lashings of
the outrigger; saw that the paddles, bailer and what not were in place; stepped the
mast; arranged the sail and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>sheet; then, with a final push, he leaped in astern and set his course for Niihau.
</p>
<p>The story of Lohiau&#x2019;s miraculous return to life spread like wild fire until the whole
population of the little island of Niihau was buzzing with the wonder. Paoa, in his
haste and excitement, neglected the ordinary civilities and failed to invite his visitor
to &#x201c;come in and eat.&#x201d; They took canoe on the instant and were the first to arrive
at Haena.
</p>
<p>At sight of Lohiau, whom they found quiet and thoughtful, surrounded by a houseful
of people, in conversation with his sister and two women who were strangers, they
set up a wailing cry of joy that was chorused by the whole company.
</p>
<p>The great raft of attendants, men and women, round-eyed with wonder, reached Haena
in successive arrivals later in the day. First came those who eagerly credited the
report of Lohiau&#x2019;s resurrection; scattering along after them, strangers and those
who were in any degree skeptical of this great mystery. Each hour saw a bunch of new
arrivals, not from Niihau alone but from all parts of Kauai.
</p>
<p>When Kahua-nui and her husband had first wept over Lohiau, embracing and kissing him,
uttering their welcome in joyous cries of wailing, they turned to the two women, the
strangers, for Lohiau bade them extend their welcome to &#x201c;these two women who have
brought me to life again.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Where are they from?&#x201d; Kahua-nui asked.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I know not; I only know they have given me life.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;It was worth while for my brother to have died to secure two such beautiful women
as you,&#x201d; said Kahua-nui as she faced Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The other one is more beautiful than we are,&#x201d; Hiiaka answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Toward the Sunrise,&#x201d; Hiiaka answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What is the name of the country?&#x201d; queried Kahua-nui.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Hawaii.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Who is the woman<span class="corr" id="xd29e7568" title="Source: ,">?</span>&#x201d; persisted Kahua-nui.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Her name is Pele.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I know her.&#x201d; Kahua-nui spoke with lower tone.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;She it was who sent us to fetch Lohiau. We found him dead. I worked according to
my ability&#x2014;you see, our man is alive again.&#x201d;

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE GODS COME TO LOHIAU&#x2019;S FEAST</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under the direction of Kahua-nui&#x2014;the woman to whom belonged the executive mind&#x2014;proclamation
was made throughout the land, in the name of Lohiau, commanding all the people to
collect the necessary food and material in preparation for a great feast, that they
might celebrate properly Lohiau&#x2019;s return to life.
</p>
<p>It was to be an occasion of <span class="corr" id="xd29e7584" title="Source: unparalled">unparalleled</span> interest and importance: a chief, famed for his manly beauty and popular talents,
rescued from the grave; the magician who had accomplished this marvel, a woman of
surpassing beauty; an old-time feast, with its lavish profusion; the hula, with its
lyric and epic thrills: a combination of attractions that appealed to every taste,
whether of sage, epicure, frivolous dilettante or dull-witted peasant, it was sure
to be the event of a lifetime. All were invited and all came.
</p>
<p>The halau in which the people assembled was a temple of Flora, or rather of her Polynesian
sister Láka. At the request of Hiiaka, whose every wish was law, one half of the hall
was screened off by a rustic partition as a special feasting hall for the gods. &#x201c;My
relatives,&#x201d; said Hiiaka, &#x201c;are numerous.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>In this part of the halau were laid the sacrificial viands for the supply of an immense
host. Having commanded silence, Hiaaka, after the manner of prayer, invited the attendance
of the gods. A hush fell upon the assembly; the air was stirred by the fanning of
many wings. No speech, no human voice, only the gentle clash of wooden dishes, the
rustle of leaves, the gurgle of deep potations and the subdued sounds of gustation
came from the place into which no human foot or eye dared intrude. At the conclusion
of the affair, when Hiiaka, in priestly fashion, had pronounced the absolving word
<i lang="haw">noa</i> and the stewards were again at liberty to enter the precinct where the immortals
had just now celebrated their symposium, it seemed, at first glance, as if nothing
had been touched. The leafy bundles of fish and fowl and meat remained unopened, but
they proved to be empty; the coconuts, unbroken, were yet devoid of meat; the bananas
were found to be but hollow skins. The substance, the essence, had been filched away
by some inscrutable power. This was the <i lang="haw">ai inoino</i>&#x2014;consumption to the last morsel&#x2014;practiced by the gods.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was a solemn affair, after all, this parting feast, at which, in spite of the babel
of voices, weighty affairs had to be settled. Malae-ha&#x2019;a-koa published the fact that
the beautiful woman who sat in their mist was Hiiaka, the sister of Pele; that her
art had captured the unhappy flitting ghost of Lohiau, restored it to its renovated
and matchless form and that, in fulfillment of her errand, she was about to lead him
away with her to be the bed-mate of the goddess who ruled the volcano.
</p>
<p>Paoa&#x2014;he whose tempestuous nature had not long ago sworn vengeance against the author
of Lohiau&#x2019;s taking-off&#x2014;now spoke up and declared his purpose to go with his master
on this his new and strange adventure. Lohiau restrained him.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I go with these two women. If I die&#x2014;so be it&#x2014;&#x2019;twere a glorious end,&#x2014;with these two
who rescued me from the grave and brought me back to the delights of your society.
If I live and make my abode on Hawaii, it will be for you to come and share the blessings
of my new home.&#x201d; Then, addressing himself specially to Paoa, &#x201c;You will remain here,
as my deputy, ruling over the land. If my adventure fares well, I will come and fetch
you&#x2014;if &#x2026; ill, your coming would not advantage.&#x2026; You shall stay here.&#x201d;

<h2 class="main">HIIAKA&#x2019;S ADDRESS TO CAPE KAENA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The mountains were still in shadow, but the star of morning was on high and rosy fingers
in the east heralded the approach of day, taming the flare of the torches and making
them almost a superfluity as the canoe&#x2014;with Hiiaka occupying the pola, Lohiau in the
stern holding the steersman&#x2019;s paddle and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o ensconced in the bow&#x2014;curvetted
to the waves and shot out into the blue sea. One paddle-stroke and the craft had cleared
the land, another and it had traversed the heaving channel of Ië-ië-waena, another
and it was beached on the sands of Mokuleia. At this point Hiiaka parted from her
two companions, directing them to call for her with the canoe at a designated place.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka&#x2019;s first care was to pay her respects to the aged one, her ancestor, Pohaku-o-Kaua&#x2019;i;
after that to her ancestral divinity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>Kaena, a name in modern times bestowed on the western cape of Oahu. She turned this
point and passed into the sweltering lea where the sun poured its merciless heat and,
as she climbed the slope of the Waianae mountain, looking back on the route just accomplished,
according to her custom, she uttered her comments in song:

<p>According to this version of the narrative, which is the preferable one, Hiiaka now
took passage in the canoe and from Maná the reunited party sailed away for Oahu. By
this happy reunion the otherwise dissevered narrative is brought into harmony and
conflicting versions no longer pull away from each other like two ill-trained steers.
</p>
<p>The voyage was not without enlivening incident. When the canoe had reached a point
where the surges began to roll in the direction of Oahu Hiiaka saw two monster sharks
disporting themselves in the waves whom she recognized as relatives on the side of
her paternal grand-father, their names being Kua and Kahole-a-Kane. This was her second
encounter with these sea-monsters; the first was on her recent voyage to Kauai, an
encounter which had threatened serious results, if not disaster, to Hiiaka&#x2019;s expedition.
As the story goes, when Kua and Kahole had become aware that Hiiaka&#x2019;s going was for
the purpose of bringing Lohiau to the bed of Pele, they were moved to great disapproval
of her enterprise: &#x201c;A mere man,&#x201d; said they. &#x201c;The idea of mating him with Pele is atrocious:
and he is a dead man at that.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>After taking counsel with the sea-goddess Moana-nui-ka-lehua, who had her boudoir
in the deep waters of Iëië-waena, with her aid they raised a commotion in the sea
and Hiiaka barely escaped being swamped by a mighty water-spout. For her part Hiiaka
was quite ready to overlook this rough play of her old kinsfolk and to do the agreeable
with them and she accordingly addressed them kindly: &#x201c;How lucky for me is this meeting
again with you out here in the ocean! It will enable me to relieve my hardships by
a smack of real comfort.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The two sea-monsters felt unable to respond to Hiiaka&#x2019;s advances in a like spirit
with her&#x2019;s. Their consciences <span class="corr" id="xd29e7766" title="Source: plead">pleaded</span> guilty. &#x201c;Look here,&#x201d; said Kua to his fellow, &#x201c;this is our grandchild.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; his companion replied, &#x201c;and she will put us to death. We&#x2019;d better hide ourselves,
you in your patch of surf, I in mine.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;That sort of a ruse won&#x2019;t avail us in the least,&#x201d; objected Kua.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What then? Where shall we flee for safety?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;To the mountains back of Waianae, to be sure,&#x201d; asserted Kua.

</p>
<p>This suggestion meeting with the approval of his companion, they hastened to land
and, having divested themselves of their shark-bodies and resumed human form, they
made for the mountains and hid themselves in the palaá fern. Hiiaka was greatly disappointed
that these two old people should have so utterly misconceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>her attitude of mind toward them as to rob her of their interesting company. She expressed
her observations in song:

last she came up with them and found them penitent, cowering in the brush, was their
retirement from the ocean: not a light stroke, however, being almost the equivalent

his native air.

<p class="first">To return now to Hiiaka, who, after a hot climb, is standing on the summit of <span class="corr" id="xd29e7891" title="Source: Pohakea">Poha-kea</span>; she is gazing with rapt and clear vision far away in the direction of her own home-land,
her <i lang="haw">moku lehua</i>, in Puna. Her eyes, under the inspiration of the moment, disregard the ocean foreground,
on whose gently heaving bosom might be seen the canoe that holds Lohiau and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
snailing along to its appointed rendezvous. Her mind is busy interpreting the unusual
signs written in the heavens: a swelling mountainous mass of flame-shot clouds, boiling
up from some hidden source. It spells ruin and desolation&#x2014;her own forest-parks blasted
and fire-smitten; but, saddest and most heart-rending of all is the thought that her
own Hopoe, the beautiful, the accomplished, the generous, the darling of her heart&#x2014;Hopoe
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>has been swallowed up in the rack. Hopoe, whose accepted emblem and favorite poetical
metamorphosis was a tall lehua tree in full blossom, is now a scarred rock teetotumed
back and forth by the tides and waves of the ocean. This thought, however much she
would put it aside, remained to fester in her heart.

<p>(We omit at this point a considerable number of mele which are ascribed to Hiiaka
and declared to have been sung by her while occupying this mountain perch at Poha-kea.

<p class="first">Hiiaka now pays attention to the doings of the people on the canoe in the offing.
It is necessary to explain that, on landing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>at Mokuleia, she had ordered her two companions to continue their voyage and meet
her on the other side of Cape Kaena whose pointed beak lay close at hand. Lohiau,
nothing loath&#x2014;a pretty woman was company enough for him&#x2014;turned the prow of the canoe
seaward and resumed his paddle. After passing the cape, the ocean calmed, making the
work of steering much less arduous. Now it was that Lohiau, feeling the warm blood
of young manhood swell the cockles of his heart and finding opportunity at hand, made
ardent love to his attractive voyage-companion. He pressed nose and lip against her&#x2019;s
and used every argument to bring her to accept his point of view.
</p>
<p>Wahine-oma&#x2019;o had a mind of her own and <span class="corr" id="xd29e7957" title="Source: thought">though</span> not at all averse to love and its doings and though very much drawn to this lover
in particular, she decidedly objected to compromising her relations with Hiiaka, but
above all, with the dread mistress of the Volcano, with whom she must ere long make
reckoning. Like Pele, Wahine-oma&#x2019;o permitted the kisses of Lohiau for a time, but,
knowing that passion grows by what it feeds on, she presently cut short his rations
and told him to behave himself, enforcing her denial with the unanswerable argument
that she was well persuaded that they would be seen by Hiiaka. It was even so. It
was worse. Hiiaka did not content herself with throwing temptation before Lohiau,
as one might place raw meat before a hungry dog; by some witchery of psychologic power
she stirred him up to do and dare, yet at the same time she impelled Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
to accept, but only a certain degree, for she carefully set bounds to their conduct.
And this, be it understood, is but the opening act of a campaign in which Hiiaka resolves
to avenge herself on Pele.
</p>
<p>When at length Hiiaka centered her attention on the actions of the people in the canoe,
it needed but a glance to tell her that the contagium planted in the soil of Lohiau&#x2019;s
mind had worked to a charm. Her own description&#x2014;though in figures that seem high-wrought
and foreign to our imaginations&#x2014;had better tell the tale:

<p class="first">Hiiaka&#x2019;s voice had the precious quality of carrying her words and making them audible
to a great distance, when she so willed. Her song, therefore, did not, on this occasion,
waste itself in the wilderness of space. The caution it imposed had its effect. Lohiau
and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o calmed their passionate contentions and proceeded discreetly on their

glisten, like two parted rows of white teeth, the coral bluffs that were the only
guard at the mouth of Pearl Lochs.

<p>Before descending from her vantage ground on Pohakea, Hiiaka indulged her fancy in
a song that was of a different strain. Looking towards Hilo, she describes the rivers,
swollen by heavy rains, rushing impetuously along in bounding torrents, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>while men and women leap into the wild current and are lifted on its billows as by

<p class="first">At the entrance to this land-locked harbor of Kou a pretty sight met their eyes: a
moving picture of men and women in the various attitudes of lying, kneeling or standing
on boards, riding the waves that chased each other toward the sandy beach. The scene
made such an appeal to Hiiaka&#x2019;s imagination that she opened her heart in song:

<p>When, after this battery of compliment, they came close up to <a id="xd29e8213"></a>the princess Pele-ula&#x2014;who, as will be seen, was a power in the land&#x2014;having exchanged
still further compliments, Hiiaka invited her to come aboard. Pele-ula, very naturally,
declined this kind offer, but with a fine show of hospitality in her turn begged that
they would honor her by being her guests during their stay in the place, assuring
them of hospitable entertainment and such pleasures as her court could offer. Under
her piloting, accordingly, they made their way by paddle across the beautiful land-locked
harbor of Kou and, entering the Nu&#x2019;uanu stream&#x2014;in those days much broader, sweeter
and deeper than now&#x2014;turned into its eastern branch and erelong found themselves at
the landing from which a path led up to Pele-ula&#x2019;s residence. Imagine the fairy scene,
if you will;&#x2014;a canoe-load of smiling nereids piloted by a mermaid princess swimming
on ahead, with a merry convoy of mermaiden and mermen following in the wake.
</p>
<p>A word in regard to this little land, now lying close to the heart of Honolulu itself,
which still bears the same name as its old-time mistress, Pele-ula. To the kamaaina
the sturdy samang tree, whose vigorous bole parts the traffic of Vineyard Street just
before its junction with the highway of Nu&#x2019;uanu has long been a familiar object. This
fine tree has a history of its own and can claim the respectable age of not less than
forty years. The land about it has borne the classic name of Pele-ula for a period
of centuries that hark back to the antiquity of Hawaiian tradition. The sightseer
of to-day who views the region from the macadamized roadway, some ten feet above the
level of the surrounding land, must not judge of its former attractiveness and fitness
as a place of residence by its present insalubrity&#x2014;now shut in by embankments, overhung
by dank and shadowy trees, its once-pure stream either diverted for economic purposes
or cluttered and defiled with the debris of civilization. A study of the region, on
the inner&#x2014;<i lang="haw">mauka</i>&#x2014;border of which lies Pele-ula, will easily convince the observer that within a short
geologic period the wash of silt and mud from higher levels has filled in and converted
what must have been at one time a clear salt-water basin into the swampy flats that
not long ago met the eye. Now, of course, this whole alluvial basin has been still
further filled in and artificially overlaid with a more-or-less solid crust of earth
and rock to meet the demands of Honolulu&#x2019;s ever expanding growth.
</p>
<p>To return to our narrative: to this hamlet of Pele-ula, such as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>it was in the days of Arcadian sweetness&#x2014;if not of light&#x2014;Hiiaka and her select company
now enter as the honored guests of a woman distinguished alike for her beauty, her
spiritual subtility and insight&#x2014;she was a <i lang="haw">makaula</i>&#x2014;and for her devotion to pleasure. One of her chief diversions, naturally enough,
was the hula, especially that form of the dance which was used in connection with
that <i lang="fr">risqué</i> entertainment, the kilu<span class="corr" id="xd29e8230" title="Source: ,">.</span><a class="noteref" id="n198asrc" href="#n198a">1</a>
</p>
<p>By evening, when the travelers had washed away the encrusting salt, warmed and dried
their apparel at an outdoor fire, filled nature&#x2019;s vacuum at the generous table of
their hostess, while they were sitting in the short gloaming of the tropics, enjoying
the delicious content that waits on rest after toil, Pele-ula interrupted the silence:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;The people will have assembled in the hall by this time. Shall we move in that direction?&#x201d;
Her glance was first at Hiiaka as the leader of the party; her gaze rested on Lohiau.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Let the resident guests be the first. When they are settled in their places it will
be time enough for us to come in,&#x201d; was the reply of Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;As you please,&#x201d; nodded Pele-ula.
</p>
<p>Wahine-oma&#x2019;o rose to her feet as Pele-ula was departing. At this move Hiiaka said,
&#x201c;When you reach the hall go and take a seat by your man friend.&#x201d; She meant Lohiau.
Thereupon she gave vent to this enigmatical utterance:

<p class="first">She turns to Lohiau and says, &#x201c;You had better be going to the hall. When you go in
take a seat by your friend.&#x201d; This advice is puzzling: the friend must have been Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
and it was customary for men and women to sit apart. Then she resumed her song:

<p class="first">The inner meaning and intent of this highly wrought figurative and allegorical language,
which Hiiaka, according to her custom, utters at detached intervals in the form of
song, does not lie on the surface, and is furthermore obscured by an untranslatable
punning use of the word Puna.
</p>
<p>To explain the motive of this song, Hiiaka perceives that Pele-ula and Lohiau, who
had once upon a time been lovers, are mutually drawn to each other by a rekindling
of the old flame. In the case of Pele-ula the motive of ambition to match her own
spiritual power as a <i lang="haw">makaula</i>&#x2014;seer&#x2014;with that of the young woman who comes to her as the plenipotential ambassador
of Pele is even stronger than the physical passion. In the kilu now to be performed
she sees her opportunity.
</p>
<p>She will use it for all it is worth, not only that she may taste once more the delights
offered by this coxcomb, but that she may pluck from the hand of this audacious creature
of Pele&#x2019;s endowment a wreath for her own wearing.
</p>
<p>As to Lohiau, that plastic thing, his character, is as clay in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>the hands of the potter, under Pele-ula&#x2019;s manipulation. He is all for pleasure. Honor,
constancy, ordinary prudence, are not in his purview. Hiiaka&#x2019;s immediate presence
suffices to restrain and guide him; in her absence, his passion, a rudderless bark,
is the sport of every wind that blows.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, on arriving at the halau, sat by herself. Lohiau, as she observed, was sitting
with Wahine-oma&#x2019;o and Waikiki. Pele-ula, who was sitting alone on her side of the
hall, now showed her hand by sending one of her men, named A&#x2019;ala, to invite Lohiau
to come over and sit with her. At this Hiiaka spoke up: &#x201c;I will sit by you.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;So be it, then,&#x201d; answered Pele-ula. At the same time she muttered to herself, &#x201c;But
she wasn&#x2019;t invited.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>A&#x2019;ala, who caught the aside of his mistress, also put in, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Lohiau whom she invites.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>At this Hiiaka bravely laid down the rule, which was the accepted one, that the men
and the women should sit on opposite sides of the halau; averring that any other disposition
would be sure to breed trouble. Pele-ula could not but agree to this and accordingly,
Wahine-oma&#x2019;o and Waikiki, leaving their seats by Lohiau, came over and sat with Hiiaka
and Pele-ula.
</p>
<p>When the presiding officer of the game&#x2014;the <i lang="haw">la anoano</i><a class="noteref" id="xd29e8412src" href="#xd29e8412">15</a>&#x2014;had called the assembly to order with the well known cry &#x201c;<i lang="haw">pu-heo-heo</i>&#x201d; and it came to the placing of the <i lang="haw">pahu kilu</i>&#x2014;short pyramidal blocks of wood&#x2014;before each one of the players, who sat in two rows
facing each other and separated by a considerable interval, Hiiaka objected to the
way in which they were placed. A sharp discussion then arose between Pele-ula and
Hiiaka, but the younger woman carried the day and won her point.
</p>
<p>Lohiau had a great and well-deserved reputation as a skilful champion in the game
of kilu. When, therefore, it came his turn to hurl the kilu<a class="noteref" id="xd29e8425src" href="#xd29e8425">16</a> and send it spinning across the mat with an aim that would make it strike the pahu,
which was its <span class="corr" id="xd29e8428" title="Source: targe">target</span>, everybody looked for great things and it was openly predicted that he would win
every point.
</p>
<p>Lohiau preluded his play with a song:

</div>
<p class="first">The &#x201c;child in the heart that has grown to be a man&#x201d; is Lohiau&#x2019;s old love for Pele-ula,
which now wakes up into new life at the sight of his old flame. The old love has,
however, in a sense become a burden. It stands in the way of the new-born affection
that has sprung up in his heart for Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>It was after the chanting of this mele that Lohiau threw his kilu. But, to the consternation
of the audience and his own bewilderment, his play was a miss. His aim had been true,
his hand steady, the whirling kilu had gone straight on its way as if sure of the
mark, then, to the utter amazement of all experts, like the needle of the compass
influenced by some hidden magnet, it had swerved and gone wild.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, from the other side of the hall, now took her turn at the kilu, with a prelude
of song:

<p class="first">In this song Hiiaka exposes the unworthy plot that was simmering in Lohiau&#x2019;s mind,
whom she typifies by a gust of wind blowing from the west, the general direction of
Kauai.
</p>
<p>At the first throw the kilu hit the wooden block and then, as if not content with
its accomplishment, after caroming off, returned like a bee to its blossom, and this
action it repeated until it had scored not one but three points. There was the thrill
of triumph in Hiiaka&#x2019;s tone as she sang again:

</p>
<p>As a prelude to her next play Hiiaka gave this song:

<p>Hiiaka&#x2019;s play this time as before was a marvellous show of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>skill. The kilu seemed possessed with an instinct of attraction for the block that
stood as her target. Like a bee that has found a rich honey-flower it returned again
and yet again, as if to drain the last particle of sweetness.
</p>
<p>Before venturing on his last play, Lohiau discarded the kilu he had been using and
chose another, thinking thus to change his luck. He also changed the style of his
song, adopting the more sensuous form called <i lang="haw">ami honua</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e8593src" href="#xd29e8593">24</a> or <i lang="haw">ku&#x2019;u pau</i>:

similar word-play, by which he turns his own name into <span class="corr" id="xd29e8615" title="Source: Nii-hau">Niihau</span>, he contrasts the calm of the latter island with the agitation of the former.

The audience was dumbfounded. In the failure to find excuse sufficient for the occasion,
it took refuge in silence.
</p>
<p>It only remains for Hiiaka to pluck the fruit which her skill has put within reach
of her hand. Her complete victory has become a foregone conclusion. Of that there
can be no question. It is, however, a question of great interest to the spectator
how she will use her victory, in what terms she will celebrate her triumph over the
woman and the recreant man who have combined their wits against hers. The answer to
this question is to be found in the song with which she preludes her last play:

<p class="first">This ironical thrust is pointed at Pele-ula, who is to see her fond hopes of a renewed
liaison with her old paramour blasted by this plucking of the fruit under her very
eyes.
</p>
<p>And yet again, when Hiiaka has made the final shot that fulfills the promise of victory
to her, still relentlessly wielding the sharp blade of irony, she gives it an extra
twist in the wound that must have made Pele-ula wince:
</p>

<p class="first">The audience, moved by Lohiau&#x2019;s ardor, went into riotous applause. Hiiaka could not
but admire the pathetic artistry of Lohiau, yet she remained the mistress of her emotions.
Pele-ula, in contrast, became visibly more excited at Lohiau&#x2019;s close approach. Turning
to the younger woman, she said, &#x201c;do you respond to this man&#x2019;s appeals?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What is it you mean?&#x201d; quietly asked Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Can it be that you are not stirred by his protestations?<a id="xd29e8831"></a> Put your hand on my bosom,&#x201d; said Pele-ula, &#x201c;and feel the throbbing of my heart.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka convinced herself of the truth of the assertion and, in turn, said, &#x201c;Do you
also lay your hand here and judge of my temper.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;You are as cool as a ti leaf,&#x201d; exclaimed Pele-ula, &#x201c;while I am as hot as a bundle
of luau.&#x201d;

him to another passage of song:

of Hiiaka. His appeals had been on the plain of human passion&#x2014;such appeals as would
have subdued and won the heart of an ordinary woman. Still acting under these limitations,
Lohiau aimed and shot the arrow that emptied his quiver of song:

<p class="first">Lohiau had broken with Pele-ula; his last hope and appeal was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>to Hiiaka. He stood before her waiting her fateful decision. Will she consent to turn
the canoe-prow and fly back to Kaua&#x2019;i with him? He had won the woman&#x2019;s heart in her,
but not the deity that controlled her nature. The chain that bound her to the Woman
of the Pit was too strong to be broken by any mere human appeal. Lohiau had failed
in his play with the kilu; he now saw that he had also failed in his attempt to play
with this human heart. The game was up; he sat down.
</p>
<p>When Lohiau had retired in defeat, it became the turn of Wahine-oma&#x2019;o to entertain
the company&#x2014;Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, faithful, rustic soul, that she was, whose only acquaintance
with this fine art was what she had picked up from seeing the performances of her
mistress and master. Her wits did not desert her and were equal to the occasion: best
of all, she had the wit to recognize her own limitations. Instead of pitching her
song to some far-fetched hyperbole, she travestied the whole performance in a wholesome
bit of nonsense that drifts down to us across the centuries as a most delicious take-off:
</p>
<div id="lg184.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">If Wahine-oma&#x2019;o had, of set purpose, planned an ironical take off of the hula kilu,
or rather of Lohiau&#x2019;s manner of acting, she could hardly have bettered her performance.
Her dancing was a grotesque ambling and mincing from one side of the theater to the
other. The unaffected good humor of the girl robbed the arrow of her wit of all venom
while detracting not one whit from its effectiveness.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hiiaka, having&#x2014;by her marvellous skill&#x2014;extricated her charge from the toils of the
enchantress, turned a deaf ear to Pele-ula&#x2019;s urgent persuasions to abide yet longer
and taste more deeply the sweets of her <span class="corr" id="xd29e8929" title="Source: hospitaliay">hospitality</span>. Her determination arrived at, she wasted no time in leave-taking but made all haste
to put a safe distance between the poor moth and the flame that was the focus of his
enchantment. Their route lay eastward across <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>the dusty, wind-swept, plain of Kula-o-kahu&#x2019;a&#x2014;destined in the coming years to be the
field of many a daring feat of arms;&#x2014;then through the wild region of Ka-imu-ki, thickset
with bowlders&#x2014;a region at one time chosen by the dwarf Menehune as a sort of stronghold
where they could safely plant their famous <i lang="haw">ti</i> ovens and be unmolested by the nocturnal depredations of the swinish Kama-pua&#x2019;a.
Hiiaka saw nothing or took no notice of these little rock-dwellers. Her gaze was fixed
upon the ocean beyond, whose waves and tides they must stem before they reached and
passed Moloka&#x2019;i and Maui, shadowy forms that loomed in the horizon between her and
her goal.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka, standing on the flank of Leahi and exercising a power of vision more wonderful
than that granted by the telescope, had sight of a wild commotion on her beloved Hawaii.
In the cloud-films that embroidered the horizon she saw fresh proof of her sister&#x2019;s
unmindfulness of the most solemn pledges. It was not her fashion to smother her emotions
with silence:

<p class="first">At Kuliouou, which they reached after passing through Wai-alae, Wai-lupe and Niu,
they came upon some women who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>catching small fish and crabs in the pools and shallow water along the shore and,
to satisfy their hunger or, perhaps, to test their disposition, Hiiaka begged the
women to grant her a portion of their catch to satisfy their need. The answer was
a surly refusal, coupled with the remark that Hiiaka would better do her own fishing.
As the sister and representative of the proud god Pele, Hiiaka could not permit the
insult to go unpunished. Her reply was the utterance of this fateful incantation:
</p>
<div id="lg187.1" lang="haw" class="lgouter">

<div id="lg187.2" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Here&#x2019;s a blast shall posset the blood,
</p>
<p class="line">As the chant of kahuna the back.
</p>
<p class="line">Our patience exhausts with delay;
</p>
<p class="line">We&#x2019;re famished from the length of the way.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The magic words operated quickly. As Hiiaka turned to depart, the unfortunate fishing
women fainted and died.
</p>
<p>After this outburst of retribution, Hiiaka turned aside to address in words of consolation
and compliment two forlorn mythical creatures whom she recognized as kindred. They
were creations of Pele, Ihihi-lau-akea, manifest to us to-day as a lifeless cinder-cone,
and Nono-ula, as a clear spring of water welling out of the mountain. It was a nice
point in Hiiaka&#x2019;s character that she was always ready, with punctilious etiquette,
to show courtesy to whom courtesy was due.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for Hiiaka, her lofty perch afforded a wide-embracing view that included
the shadowy forms of Maui and the lesser islands that nested with it. Not the smallest
pirogue could steal away from the strip of rocky beach at her feet without her observation.
At this moment she caught sight of two sailor-men in the act of launching a trim canoe
into the troubled waters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>of the Hanauma cove, and she made haste, accordingly, to come to them, on the chance
of securing a passage, if so be that they were voyaging in the desired direction.
Their destination proving to be Moloka&#x2019;i, Hiiaka begged the men to receive herself
and party as passengers. Nothing loath, they gave their consent.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; said one of them, &#x201c;your party by itself is quite large enough to fill the canoe.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>His companion, with better show of cheer in his speech, spoke up and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s but
common luck to be swamped in this rough channel. To avoid it needs only skill. Even
if the craft swamps, these people need not drown; we can swim for it, and we shall
all fare alike. We&#x2019;ll take you with us. Come aboard.&#x201d; Aboard they went.
</p>
<p>The voyage to Moloka&#x2019;i proved uneventful. They landed at Iloli, a barren place that
offered no provision to stay their hunger. When Hiiaka, therefore, learned that these
same canoe-men were bound for the neighboring island of Maui, she wisely concluded
to continue the voyage with them.
</p>
<p>On landing in Kohala, Hiiaka took the road that led up through the thickly wooded
wilderness of Mahiki, the region that had been the scene, now some months gone, of
the most strenuous chapter in her warfare to rid Hawaii of the mo&#x2019;o&#x2014;that pestilent
brood of winged and crawling monsters great and small that once infested her wilds
and that have continued almost to the present day to infest the imagination of the
Hawaiian people. On coming to the eminence called Pu&#x2019;u O&#x2019;ioina,&#x2014;a name signifying
a resting place&#x2014;being now in the heart of the damp forest of Moe-awa, they found the
trail so deep with mire that the two women drew up their paü and tucked them about
their waists. At sight of this action, Lohiau indulged himself in some frivolous jesting
remarks which called out a sharp rebuke from Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>As they cleared the deep woods, there burst upon them a view of the Hamakua coast-wall
here and there dotted with clumps of puhala and fern, at intervals hung with the white
ribbons of waterfalls hastening to join the great ocean. As Hiiaka gazed upon the
scene, she uttered her thoughts in song:
</p>
<p>(In literature, as in other matters, the missing sheep always makes a strong appeal
to the imagination. Urged by this motive, I have searched high and low for this mele,
the utterance of Hiiaka under unique conditions; but all my efforts have been unavailing.)
</p>
<p>When they had passed through the lands of Kukia-lau-ania <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>and Maka-hana-loa and were overlooking the town of Hilo, Hiiaka was better able to
judge of the havoc which the fires of Pele had wrought in her Puna domains. The land
was desolated, but, worst of all, the life of her dearest friend Hopoe had been sacrificed
on the altar of jealousy. In her indignation, Hiiaka swore vengeance on her sister
Pele. &#x201c;I have scrupulously observed the compact solemnly entered into between us,
and this is the way she repays me for all my labor! Our agreement is off: I am free
to treat him&#x2014;as my lover, if I so please. But it shall not be here and now. I will
wait till the right occasion offers, till her own eyes shall witness her discomfiture.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>After this outburst, her thoughts fashioned themselves in song:

on the young woman who had been committed to her charge. The effort, which has been
made, to associate her in some mystical fashion with the paü, short skirt, worn by
Hiiaka, only deepens the mystery, so far as my understanding of the affair is concerned.)
</p>
<p>Obedient to the instructions of their mistress, the faithful women, Wahine-oma&#x2019;o and
Pau-o-pala&#x2019;e, presented themselves before Pele at the crater of Kilauea. &#x201c;Where is
my sister? where is Hiiaka?&#x201d; demanded the jealous goddess. No explanation would suffice.
Pele persisted in regarding them as deserters and, at her command, they were put to
death.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has come at last, the situation to which the logic of events has for many days
pointed the finger of a relentless fate. For the first time Hiiaka finds herself alone
with Lohiau. The history of her life during the past two months seems but a prologue
to the drama, the opening scene of which is about to be enacted in the dressing room,
as we must call it. For Hiiaka, having gathered a lapful of that passion-bloom, the
scarlet lehua, and having plaited three wreaths, with a smile on her face, hangs two
of the wreaths about the neck of Lohiau, using the third for her own adornment.
</p>
<p>They are sitting on the sacred terrace of Ka-hoa-lii, at the very brink of the caldera,
in full view of the whole court, including the sisters of Hiiaka who gather with Pele
in the Pit. &#x201c;Draw nearer,&#x201d; she says to Lohiau, &#x201c;that I may tie the knot and make the
fillet fast about your neck.&#x201d; And while her fingers work with pliant art, her lips
quiver with emotion in song:

chorus: &#x201c;Oh, look! Hiiaka kisses Lohiau! She kisses your lover, Lohiau!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The excitement rises to fever heat. Pele is the coolest of the lot. At the first outcry&#x2014;&#x201c;they
kiss&#x201d;&#x2014;Pele remarks with seeming indifference, &#x201c;The nose was made for kissing.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e9123src" href="#xd29e9123">1</a> (The Hawaiian kiss was a flattening of nose against nose). But when Hiiaka and Lohiau
sink to the earth wrapped in each other&#x2019;s arms, and the women of Pele&#x2019;s court raise
the cry, &#x201c;For shame! they kiss; they embrace!&#x201d; At this announcement, the face of Pele
hardens and her voice rings out with the command: &#x201c;Ply him with fire.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>From Pele&#x2019;s viewpoint, the man, her lover, Lohiau was the sinner. The role played
by the woman, her sister, Hiiaka&#x2014;the one who had, in fact, deliberately planned this
offensive exhibition of insubordination and rebellion&#x2014;was either not recognized by
Pele or passed by as a matter of temporary indifference. Hiiaka&#x2019;s justification in
motives of revenge found no place in her reasoning.
</p>
<p>When the servants of Pele&#x2014;among them the sisters of Hiiaka&#x2014;found themselves under
the cruel necessity of executing the edict, they put on their robes of fire and went
forth, but reluctantly. In their hearts they rebelled, and, one and all, they agreed
that, if, at close view, they found him to be the supremely handsome mortal that fame
had reported him to be, they would use every effort to spare him. On coming to the
place, their admiration passed all bounds. They could not believe their eyes. They
had never seen a manly form of such beauty and grace. With one voice they exclaimed:
</p>

<p>Pele&#x2019;s fire-brigade went through the form of obeying their orders. They dared not
do otherwise. Acting, however, on their preconcerted plan, they contented themselves
with casting a few cinders on the reclining form of Lohiau and, then, shamefaced,
they ran away&#x2014;an action that had the appearance of reproof rather than of punishment.
</p>
<p>The effect on the mind of Hiiaka, whose insight into the character of Pele was deeper
than that of Lohiau, was far different from that of mere admonition or reproof. She
recognized in the falling cinders a threat of the direst import and at once braced
herself to the task of averting the coming storm and of disarming the thundercloud
that was threatening her lover. &#x201c;Have you not some prayer to offer?&#x201d; she said to Lohiau.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he answered, and at her request he uttered the following:

in Kahiki&#x2014;Kukulu o Kahiki&#x2014;and gained a reputation as a benevolent deity, whose benign
function&#x2014;shared by Kane-milo-hai&#x2014;was to pluck from the jaws of death those who lay
at the last gasp (<i lang="haw">mauli-awa</i>), or whose vital spark was at the last flicker (<i lang="haw">pua-aneane</i>). He healed the palsied, the helpless and hopeless, those who were beyond the reach
of human aid. On one occasion he restored himself to perfect health and soundness
by the exercise of his own will; hence his name, Kane-apua. On another occasion he
illustrated his power by restoring to life some okuhekuhe which the fisherman had
already scaled and laid upon the fire. The motive for this act seems to have been
that this fish was a form in which he sometimes appeared. The story of his adventure
with Kane-lelei-aka is worthy of mention. At one time while standing on a headland
that reached out into the ocean like the prow of a ship, his eye caught a gleam from
something moving swiftly through the water. He saw it repeatedly passing and repassing
and wondered what it was. It was the shadowy form of Kane-lelei-aka, but he knew it
not. He scanned the surrounding mountains and cliffs, if perchance he might get sight
of the body, bird, or spirit that produced this reflection. He discovered nothing.
In pursuit of his quest, he started to go to Kukulu-o-Kahiki. On the way he met his
relative Kane-milo-hai, out in mid <span class="corr" id="xd29e9203" title="Source: ovean">ocean</span>.

<p class="footnote cont">&#x201c;Are you from Kanaloa?&#x201d; asked Kane-milo-hai. That meant are you from Lana&#x2019;i, Kanaloa
being the name formerly given to that little island.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&#x201c;Aye, I am from Kanaloa and in pursuit of a strange shadowy thing that flits through
the ocean and evades me.&#x201d;
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to recognize that it is only a shadow, a reflection. The real body
is in the heavens. What you are pursuing is but the other intangible body, which is
represented by the body of Kane-mano. He is speeding to reach his home in <i lang="haw">Ohe-ana</i>&#x201d; (a cave in the deep sea, in the Kai-popolohua-a-Kane).
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&#x201c;How then shall I overtake him?&#x201d; asked Kane-pua.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&#x201c;You will never succeed this way. You are no better off than a kolea (plover) that
nods, moving its head up and down (<i lang="haw">kunou</i>). Your only way is to return with me and start from the bread-fruit tree of Lei-walo
(<i lang="haw">Ka ulu o Lei-walo</i>). You must make your start with a flying leap from the topmost branch of that tree.
In that way you can come up to him and catch him.&#x201d;

of men and her fellow gods. Her name was then called Walewale-o-Ku. Kane, it is said,
took her in hand and weaned her from her bad practice; after which she was called
Kini-maka, Forty-thousand-eyes. The phrase <i lang="haw">o ka la</i> affixed to her name discountenances the idea that she is the one here intended. It
becomes evident that the whole expression means rather the many eyes of the Sun, i.e.,

on their mood and the character of their errand, whether peaceful, warlike, etc. The
answer given in the text (line 20 of the translation) is <i>Their skirts were fern and leaf of the ti</i>.

<p>&#x201c;Cowed, and by a boy!&#x201d; said Pele as her servants, with shame in their faces, slunk
away from their unfinished task. &#x201c;This is no job for women,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;These
girls can&#x2019;t stand up before a man&#x2014;not if he has a smooth face and a shapely leg.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>As she spoke the fire-lake in Hale-ma&#x2019;u-ma&#x2019;u took on a ruddier hue, lifted in its
cauldron and began to boil furiously, spouting up a score of red fountains.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Men, gods, take these fires and pour them upon the man,&#x201d; said Pele, addressing Lono-makua,
Ku-pulupulu, Ku-moku-halii, Ku-ala-na-wao, Kupa-ai-ke&#x2019;e, Ka-poha-kau, Ka-moho-alii,
Kane-milo-hai and many others.
</p>
<p>The gods well knew on what perilous ground they stood, with whom they had to deal,
the fierceness of Pele&#x2019;s wrath when it was stirred; yet, in their hatred of a great
wrong, they moved with one purpose to push back the fires that were threatening Lohiau.
With their immortal hands they flung away the embers and masses of flame until the
heavens were filled with meteor-fragments.
</p>
<p>Pele&#x2019;s wrath rose to a mighty heat at this act of mutiny and disloyalty and she cursed
the whole assembly. &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; said she, &#x201c;back to Huli-nu&#x2019;u whence you came. Let the land
on which you stand remain barren and yield no harvest nor any food for mortal or for
immortal.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Now Pele was one of the chief gods on earth. The land was hers. Did she not make it?
Her authority extended also to heaven. Did not her flames mount to the zenith? All
the gods, even the great gods Ku, Kane, Kanaloa and Lono, depended on her for certain
things. When she voyaged from Kahiki to the new land of Hawaii they were constrained
to follow her. Not because of any command she laid upon them did they do this, but
because such was their inclination. Where Pele was there was food, wealth, the things
they had need of. They followed as a dog tags after its master.
</p>
<p>The threat made by Pele was, then, no idle breath. It was a thing of terrible moment&#x2014;to
be stripped of their fat offices and banished to a far-off barren land, a terrible
sentence. Some of the gods gave in at once and made their peace with the terrible
goddess. Of those who stood firm in their opposition were Ku-moku-hali&#x2019;i, Ku pulu-pulu,
Ku-ala-na-wao, Kupa-ai-ke&#x2019;e and Ku-mauna.<a class="noteref" id="n201xsrc" href="#n201x">9</a> Condemned to banishment, they were indeed in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>sorry plight. They found themselves on the instant deprived of their jobs and of their
power. Food they had not, nor the means of obtaining it; these were in the possession
of Kane and Kanaloa. The ocean was not free to them; it was controlled by Ka-moho-alii.
In their extremity they became vagabonds and took to the art of canoe-making. Thus
were they enabled to fly to other lands.
</p>
<p>New dispositions having been made and fresh stratagems set on foot, Pele turned loose
another deluge of fire, Lono-makua consenting to manage the operation. The fire burst
into view at Keaau, from which place it backed up into the region of Ola&#x2019;a and there
divided into two streams, one of which continued on the Hilo side, while the other
followed a course farther towards Kau. Lohiau, thus surrounded, would find himself
obliged to face Pele&#x2019;s wrath without the possibility of retreat.

bade him pray; and this was the prayer he offered:

its austerity. Above the horizon-line swell the broad-based shapes of Mauna-kea, Mauna-loa
and Hualalai. In the immediate foreground, overlooking the caldera&#x2014;where are Pele&#x2019;s
headquarters&#x2014;we see two figures, standing, crouching, or reclining, the lovers whose
stolen bliss has furnished Pele with the pretext for her fiery discipline. Measured
by the forces in opposition to them, their human forms shrink into insignificance.
Measured by the boldness of their words and actions, one has to admit the power of
the human will to meet the hardest shocks of fortune. Listen to the swelling words

<p>&#x201c;Prayer may serve in time of health; it&#x2019;s of no avail in the day of death,&#x201d; was his
answer.

<p>It was not now a band of women with firebrands, but a phalanx of fire that closed
in upon Lohiau. The whole land seemed to him to be a-flame. The pictures that flit
through his disturbed mind are hinted at in the song he utters. The pangs of dissolution
seem to have stirred his deeper nature and to have given him a thoughtfulness and
power of expression that were lacking in the heyday of his lifetime. Hiiaka called
on him for prayer and this was his response:

about thirty feet high, partly overgrown with ferns and moss, situated in the lower
edge of the forest-belt, that lies to the south and Kau of Mauna-loa, deserves more
than passing mention. The region in which this rock is situated is declared by vulcanologists
to have been one vast caldera and must have been the scene of tremendous disturbances.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Up to the present time the Hawaiians have continued to hold Ku-mauna in great reverence
mingled with fear. The following modern instance is<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212n" href="#pb212n">212</a>]</span>not only a true story, and interesting, but also furnishes an illustration of the
attitude of mind of the Hawaiian people generally,&#x2014;or many of them&#x2014;towards their old
gods.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">During a period of severe drought in the district of Kau, Hawaii, a gentleman named
S&#x2014;&#x2014;, while hunting in the neighborhood of the rock that bears the name Ku-mauna, took
occasion to go out of his way and visit the rock. Standing before the rocky mass and
calling it by name, he used towards it insulting and taunting epithets, professing
to hold it responsible for the drought that was distressing the land. He concluded
his tirade by discharging his rifle point blank against the face of the rock, resulting
in the detachment of a considerable fragment.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The vaqueros in the employ of Mr. S.&#x2014;&#x2014;, who were assisting in the hunt, horrified
at the sacreligious act, at once put spurs to their horses and made off, predicting
the direst consequences from the rash act of Mr. S&#x2014;&#x2014;.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Now for the denouement: Within about ten days of this occurrence, the valley, on one
side of which Mr. S&#x2014;&#x2014; had his residence, was visited by a violent rain-storm&#x2014;such
as would in popular speech be termed a cloud-burst. There was a mighty freshet, the
waters of which reached so high as to flood his garden and threaten the safety of
his house, which he saved only by the most strenuous exertions. The land which had
been his garden was almost entirely washed away and in its place was deposited a pell-mell
of stones.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Needless to say, that, by the natives, this incident was and is regarded to this day
as conclusive evidence of the divine power of Ku-mauna and of his wrath at the audacious
person who insulted him. Special significance is attached to the fact that as part
of Ku-mauna&#x2019;s reprisal the place that had been a garden was turned into a field of
rocks. The only wonder is that Mr. S&#x2014;&#x2014; got off with so light a punishment.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n201xsrc">&#x2191;</a></p>

heard, in the distance, the sound of hula drums and other rude instruments mingling
with the voices of men chanting the songs of the hula. This seems to be the kani referred
to.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd29e9631src">&#x2191;</a></p>

<p class="first">Lohiau, in his last agony, wandered in mind and babbled of many things. To his credit,
be it said that his thoughts were not wholly centered on himself. There was a margin
of regard for others, as when he sang in these words:

<p class="first">At the last flicker of life, when the rocky encasement had well nigh completed the
envelopment of his body, Hiiaka, daring the barrier of fire that had come between
them, sprang to his side and, with the last kiss, whispered into his ear, &#x201c;Go not
on the side whence the wind blows; pass to leeward, on the day of our meeting.&#x201d; (<i lang="haw">Mai hele i ka makani; hele i ka pohu, ma ka la a kaua e halawai ai.</i>) By this cryptic expression, Hiiaka meant to put Lohiau on his guard against enemies
that lay in wait for him. If he went to the windward he might reveal himself to them
by his flair. She also embodied her warning in song:

<p class="first">A swarm of emotions buzzed in the chambers of Hiiaka&#x2019;s mind, of love, of self-destruction,
of revenge. In an agony of indecision she strode this way and that, wringing her hands
and wailing in a strictly human fashion. The master passion came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>to the front and had sway: she would find Lohiau, and with him renew the bond of friendliness
which had grown up in the midst of the innocent joys and toils of travel shared by
them in common. An access of divine power came to her. She immediately began to tear
up the strata of the earth. As she broke through the first stratum and the second,
she saw nothing. She tore her way with renewed energy: rock smote against rock and
the air was full of flying debris.
</p>
<p>After passing the third stratum, she came upon a ghastly sight&#x2014;the god of suicide,
suspended by the neck, his tongue protruding from his mouth. It was a solemn lesson.
After passing the fourth stratum she came upon the stratum of Wakea, and here she
found the inanimate bodies of her former companions of travel, the faithful Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
and Paú-o-pala&#x2019;e. She restored them to life and animation, bidding them return to
the beautiful world of sunshine and fresh air.
</p>
<p>She came at last to the tenth stratum with full purpose to break up this also and
thus open the flood-gates of the great deep and submerge Pele and her whole domain
in a flood of waters. That, indeed, would have been the ruin of all things. At this
moment there came to <span class="corr" id="xd29e10270" title="Source: Hiaaka">Hiiaka</span> the clear penetrating tone of a familiar voice. It was the voice of her fast friend
and traveling companion, Wahine-oma&#x2019;o, who had but recently left her and who, now,
under the inspiration of the great god Kane, had come to dissuade Hiiaka from her
purpose. For the execution of that purpose meant a universe in confusion. It was time,
then, for Kane to interfere. He did this by putting into the mouth <span class="corr" id="xd29e10273" title="Source: of of">of</span> her dearest friend on earth an appeal to which Hiiaka could not but listen and, listening,
heed:

</div>
<p class="first">For Hiiaka to give ear to the pleading voice of her friend, the woman who had shared
with her the shock of battle and the hardships of travel from Hawaii to Kaua&#x2019;i and
back again, was to run the risk of being persuaded.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Come with me,&#x201d; said Wahine-oma&#x2019;o; &#x201c;let us return to our mistress.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I must first seek and find Lohiau,&#x201d; answered Hiiaka.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Better for us first to go before Pele. She will send and bring Lohiau.&#x201d; Thus pleaded
the woman Wahine-oma&#x2019;o.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka turned from the work of destruction and, hand in hand, they made their way
back into the light and wholesome air of the upper world.
</p>
<p>The sisters&#x2014;those who bore the name Hiiaka&#x2014;received her cordially enough. They prattled
of many things; buzzed her with questions about her travels of long ago&#x2014;as it now
seemed to Hiiaka. It was not in their heart to stir the embers of painful issues.
No more was it in their heart to fathom the little Hiiaka of yesterday, the full-statured
woman of to-day. Beyond the exchange of becoming salutations, Hiiaka&#x2019;s mouth was sealed.
Until Pele should see fit to lend ear and heart to her speech not a word would she
utter regarding her journey.
</p>
<p>But Pele lay on her hearth silent, sullen&#x2014;no gesture, no look of recognition.
</p>
<p>The kino wailua, or spirit from Lohiau, in the meantime, after having in vain tried
to solace itself with the companionship of the forest song-birds and having found
that resource empty of human comfort, fluttered across the desolate waste of ocean
like a tired sea-bird back to his old home and there appeared to his aikane Paoa in
a vision at night.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Come and fetch me,&#x201d; he said (meaning, of course, his body). &#x201c;You will find me lying
asleep at Kilauea.&#x201d;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paoa started up in a fright. &#x201c;What does this mean?&#x201d; he said to himself. &#x201c;That Lohiau
is in trouble?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>When he had lain down again the same vision repeated itself. This time the command
was imperative: &#x201c;Come and rescue me; here I am in the land of non-recognition.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e10321src" href="#xd29e10321">2</a>
</p>
<p>Now Paoa roused himself, assured that Lohiau&#x2019;s sleep was that of death, but not knowing
that he was, for the second time, the victim of Pele&#x2019;s wrath. He said nothing to anyone
but made all his preparations for departure in secret, reasoning that Kahua-nui, the
sister of Lohiau, would not credit his story and would consequently interfere with
his plans.
</p>
<p>He entered his canoe and, pressing the water with his paddle, his craft made a wonderful
run towards Hawaii. It was necessary for him only to dip his paddle in the brine at
intervals and to direct the course. The canoe seemed almost to move of itself<span class="corr" id="xd29e10328" title="Not in source">.</span> That same morning he arrived at Waipio. To his astonishment, there, in a boat-shed
on the beach lay the canoe which he recognized as that of his friend Lohiau. The people
of the district had been wondering whose it was and how it had come there.
</p>
<p>Paoa found many things that were new and strange to him in this big raw island of
Hawaii. Not the least of these was the land on which he trod, in places a rocky shell
covering the earth like the plates on the back of the turtle, or, it might be, a tumble
of jagged rocks&#x2014;the so-called aä&#x2014;a terrain quite new to his experience. It seemed
as if the world-maker had not completed his work.
</p>
<p>Of the route to Kilauea he was quite ignorant, but he was led. There flitted before
him a shadow, a wraith, a shape and he followed it. At times he thought he could recognize
the form of Lohiau and, at night or in the deep shadows of the forest, he seemed to
be looking into the face of his friend.
</p>
<p>When night came he lay down in a sheltered place and slept. In the early morning,
while darkness yet brooded over the land, he was roused by the appearance of a light.
His first thought was that day had stolen upon him: but no, it was the kino wailua
of his friend that had come to awaken him and lead him on the last stage of his journey.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under the lead of his spiritual guide, Paoa arrived that day at Kilauea and, standing
at the brink of the great caldera, he saw the figure of Lohiau beckoning to him as
it stood on a heap of volcanic debris. The wraith dissolved into nothingness as he
approached the spot; but there lay a figure in stone having the semblance of a man.
It was more an act of divination than the exercise of ordinary judgment that told
him this was the body of Lohiau. &#x201c;I thought you had summoned me to take home your
living body, my friend!&#x201d; was his exclamation. His voice was broken with emotion as
he poured out his lament:

a pale lemon color. This pale variety shows a faint pink or reddish ring about the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The eminence of Akani-kolea stood near at hand and offered Paoa a vantage ground for
better contemplation of the mysterious earth-pit, and when the first tide of emotion
had swept by thither he repaired. Looking down into the desolate abyss, his gaze centered
on a group of human figures, beautiful women, seated on the vast plates of pahoehoe
that made the floor of the caldera. He saw but four of them, Pele herself not being
visible. He had no clue as to their identity and was only impressed as by the sight
of beautiful women who were to him as goddesses. The grandeur and strangeness of the
scene moved him to song:

</div>
<p class="first">Pele, in the retirement of her gloomy cavern, was quite out of the range of Paoa&#x2019;s
eye-shot, but his voice rang in her ears distinctly. &#x201c;What a handsome man is that
standing on the edge of the cliff at Akani-kolea!&#x201d; exclaimed Pele&#x2019;s women, unable
to repress their admiration.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Call to him and invite him to come down here where we can talk together,&#x201d; said Pele.
&#x201c;Way up there on the pali wall&#x2014;that&#x2019;s no place for us to talk and become acquainted
with each other. Tell him to come down here and we&#x2019;ll discuss matters great and small,
look upon the large stem and the small stem; see one another face to face; learn each
other&#x2019;s heart&#x2019;s desire.&#x201d;<a class="noteref" id="xd29e10850src" href="#xd29e10850">1</a>
</p>
<p>For all her fine words. Pele did not at once come forward and meet her visitor face
to face. She lay unrecognized in her stygian boudoir, to all appearance a withered
hag.
</p>
<p>Paoa, well versed in the wiles of Woman, adept in the logomachies and etiquettes of
court-life, was quite put to his trumps and found it necessary to summon all his diplomacy
and exercise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>all his power of self-command in dealing with the shrewd and attractive women that
surrounded him. It was evident to the watchful eye of our heroine&#x2014;Hiiaka&#x2014;that he was
dangerously attracted by the voluptuous beauty of her sister, Hiiaka-of-the-waves.
In the persistent silence of Pele, upon her fell the leading part of the conversation
with Paoa:
</p>
<p>&#x201c;What might be the purpose of your pilgrimage?&#x201d; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I come in answer to the call of my friend, Lohiau.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;But Lohiau is dead,&#x201d; chorused the women.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes, dead! And what was the cause of his death?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;He kissed Hiiaka,&#x201d; the woman answered.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Ah! but who killed him?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Pele.&#x201d; Her voice sank to a whisper, and the name she uttered was to be made out,
or guessed at, rather by a study of the protruding lips and the sympathetic arching
of the brow than by any sound emitted. Her eyes also made a half-turn in the direction
of Pele&#x2019;s cave.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;He came to Hawaii in the expectation that Pele would be his life.&#x201d; Paoa spoke with
thoughtful deliberation. &#x201c;How came it about that she should cause his death?&#x201d; &#x2026; After
a moment&#x2019;s pause, he continued: &#x201c;He tasted death once at Haena and, now, again, here,
on this barren &#x2026; a second death, and through the wrath of Pele!&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Pele roused herself at this and spoke up: &#x201c;What is that you say? that Lohiau died
at Haena?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Yes, he tasted of death there,&#x201d; Paoa answered firmly.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;How, then, did he become alive again?&#x201d; asked Pele sharply.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Hiiaka, she treated him, and by her gracious skill and power brought his soul and
body together again. That done, they sailed away for Hawaii.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>The eyes of Pele were literally, as well as metaphorically, opened. She turned herself
about and, in a lowered voice, with a show of astonishment, for the first time, addressed
Hiiaka: &#x201c;Is this true, that you worked over Lohiau and restored him to life?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;It is true, and it is also true that, not until you had put to death Hopoe, did I
bestow any dalliance or caress of love upon Lohiau.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Hiiaka&#x2019;s expression as she faced Pele was such as might have sat upon the countenance
of a judge passing sentence on a confessed criminal at the bar.
</p>
<p>Pele sat impenetrable, sphinxlike, deep in her own labyrinthine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>philosophy of the obligations due to a social autocrat and a goddess.
</p>
<p>Paoa broke the silence: &#x201c;Shall not Lohiau, then, live again?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Go back to Haena,&#x201d; said Pele, &#x201c;and when you hear that Lohiau lives again, then will
be the time for you to come and take him home.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;That would be well, then,&#x201d; said Paoa.
</p>
<p>A spell of confusion, of enchantment, seemed now to fall upon the man whilom so boastful.
&#x201c;But where is Pele?&#x201d; he asked, looking from face to face.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;That is Pele,&#x201d; said the goddess, pointing to her sister Wave (Hiiaka-i-ka-ale-i).
</p>
<p>&#x201c;I have a sign by which I may know Pele; let me apply the test to these women,&#x201d; said
Paoa.
</p>
<p>The company could but agree to this; whereupon, beginning with Wave, he took each
one of them in turn by the hand, carrying it to his cheek, the better to test its
warmth, holding the hollow to his ear to catch any murmur that might reverberate from
it. Each hand he found to be only of natural heat. Turning, then, to Pele herself,
he proposed to inspect her hand. At this the goddess drew back.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;If none of these beautiful women is Pele, how can you think that a wrinkled old woman
like me is the divine and beautiful Pele?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Paoa insisted and Pele had to consent. He reached out and took her hand and, on the
instant, dropped it; it was burning hot.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;This is Pele!&#x201d; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Paoa stood in awed silence before the goddess. Resentment and thoughts of revenge,
like evil birds, had taken flight.
</p>
<p>At Pele&#x2019;s command, the women led him away to take refreshment in the sacred dining
hall of Mauli-ola. Before seating himself, Paoa uttered this memorable pule, a mele
that has drifted down to us from the <i lang="haw">wa po</i><span class="corr" id="xd29e10901" title="Not in source">:</span>

</div>
<p class="first">This <i lang="haw">pule</i>, which I have heard spoken of as <i lang="haw">ka pule kanawai</i>&#x2014;from the use of the word kanawai in the last part of the mele, dates back, it is
said, to the time of Paao, the priest and chief who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>came to Hawaii from Samoa in the remote ages. Paoa&#x2019;s argument&#x2014;if he can be said to
have had any&#x2014;seems to be that Pele should cast away, throw into the ocean, the lumber
of old laws and tabus and start afresh.
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject&#x2014;the consideration of the mele&#x2014;I must mention, apropos of
the expression <i lang="haw">pahu kapu a ka leo</i>, in verse 54, an incident related to me by a Hawaiian friend (J.&nbsp;M. P.). He says
that when he was a boy, his mother, when a thunder-storm arose, would often say to
him, &#x201c;keep silence! that&#x2019;s Kane-hekili.&#x201d; In Kahuku, island of Oahu, at a place not
far from the sugar-mill, is a cave, known as <i lang="haw">Keana</i>. In former times this cave was the home where lived a mother and her two sons. One
day, having occasion to journey to a distance, she left them with this injunction,
&#x201c;If during my absence you hear the sound of thunder, keep still, make no disturbance,
don&#x2019;t utter a word. If you do it will be your death.&#x201d; During her absence, there sprang
up a violent storm of thunder and lightning, and the young lads made an outcry of
alarm. Thereupon a thunderbolt struck them dead, turning their bodies into stone.
Two pillar-shaped stones standing at the mouth of the cave are to this day pointed
out in confirmation of the truth of the legend.
</p>
<p>As Paoa concluded his prayer-song the eyes of the whole company were turned upon him,
and on the lips of them all was the question, &#x201c;Was she then your God?&#x201d;
</p>
<p>&#x201c;She is my God,&#x201d; he answered, &#x201c;and my ancestors from the earliest times have worshipped
her.&#x201d; &#x2026; Then, turning his eyes about him, as if to survey the land, he continued,
&#x201c;If this were my land, as is Kaua&#x2019;i, there would be no lack of good and wholesome
food-provision, and that of all kinds. Things are different here &#x2026; I am a stranger
in this land.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>On hearing these words, which had in them the sting of truth, for poison had been
mixed with some of the food, the women stealthily hid away certain dishes and substituted
for them others.
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the repast the women who had been in attendance brought him a
girdle delicately embroidered with fibers from the coconut that he might be suitably
appareled for his interview with the woman Pele. &#x201c;You will find,&#x201d; they said, &#x201c;that
Pele is in reality a woman of wonderful beauty.&#x2026; In order to win her, however, you
will need to use all your arts of fascination &#x2026; and your caution as well. Make hot
love <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>to her, but, look out! don&#x2019;t let your fancy lead you to smile upon any other beauty.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Pele at first kept Paoa at a distance and, with deep subtlety, said to him, &#x201c;Here
are beautiful women&#x2014;women more beautiful than I&#x2014;take one of them.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Paoa, well schooled in courtly etiquette and logomachy, was not tripped up by any
such snare as Pele laid for him. He stood his ground and faced the god as an equal.
</p>
<p>As Pele contemplated Paoa it dawned upon her that here stood a man, a being of gracious
power, one who combined in himself qualities&#x2014;attractions&#x2014;she had never before seen
materially embodied in the human form. The woman in Pele laid aside the god&#x2014;the akua&#x2014;and
came to the front<span class="corr" id="xd29e11178" title="Not in source">.</span> All thought of bantering talk and word-play slunk away: her whole being was sobered
and lifted up. The change in her outward, physical appearance kept pace with the inward:
the rough armor that had beset her like the prongs of horned coral, both without and
within, melted and dropped away; the haglike wrinkles ceased to furrow her profile.
Her whole physical being took on the type of womanly perfection.
</p>
<p>And what of Paoa, the man who had come with heart full of bitterness, determined on
revenge? He was conquered, overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>Their meeting was that of lovers, who stood abashed in each other&#x2019;s presence. Pele&#x2019;s
beauty and charm were like that of a young bride coming to the nuptial couch.&#x2026;
</p>
<p>The dalliance and love-making of Pele and Paoa was a honeymoon that continued for
three days and three nights. By virtue of this mysterious union with the goddess,
Paoa acquitted himself of a ceremonial duty, as it were, and thus gained Pele&#x2019;s dispensation
from further obligations to her bed and the liberty of exercising free choice among
all the beautiful women that thronged Pele&#x2019;s court. It was there he made his abode
until the time for his return to his own Kaua&#x2019;i.

last independent monarch, Ka-umu-alii, by fourteen generations, which would bring
his reign in the first half of the fifteenth century. He has the honor, unique among
Hawaiian kings, of having his name affixed as a sobriquet to the island that was his
kingdom. Whether the use of his name in this connection, apparently as a god, is to
be regarded as antedating its occurrence in the Ulu genealogy (given by Fornander.
See <i>The Polynesian Race</i>; vol. I, p. 195.), or whether, on the other hand, it is to be considered as an apotheosis

as a pillar, such as Pele set up, due regard for which demanded silence. Another,
equally well informed, defines it as an edict, or canon. To the writer it seems more

against her sister that she could not again take her former place as a member of Pele&#x2019;s
court. Hawaii was the largest island of the group, but it was not large enough to
hold herself and Pele. Of all the islands Kaua&#x2019;i was the one most remote from the
scene of her troubles; it was also the land which Lohiau had claimed as his own&#x2014;and
his was a name that called up only the most tender emotions. To Kaua&#x2019;i would she go.
</p>
<p>The company of those who shared her feelings and whose personal attachment to her
was sufficient to lead them with herself in a venture of new fortunes was not large.
It included, of course, her two staunch attendants, Pau-o-pala&#x2019;e and Wahine-oma&#x2019;o
and, strangely enough, a considerable quota of the sisters who shared with her the
name Hiiaka (qualified though it was in each case by some additional distinguishing
epithet). Towards Kaua&#x2019;i, then, did they set their faces or, more literally, turn
the prow of their canoe.
</p>
<p>Many unforeseen things, however, were to happen before the God of Destiny would permit
her to gain her destination. Other strands stood ready to be interwoven with the purposeful
threads Hiiaka was braiding into her life.
</p>
<p>In the ancient regime of Hawaii, the halau, as the home and school of the hula, stood
for very much and for many things. It served, after a fashion, as a social exchange
or clearing house for the whole nation; the resort of every wandering minstrel, bohemian
soul or <i lang="fr">beau esprit</i> whose oestrus kept him in travel; the rallying point of souls dislocated from an
old and not yet accommodated to a new environment; a place where the anxious and discouraged,
despairing of a new outlook, or seeking balm for bruised hearts, might quaff healing
nepenthe.
</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that Hiaaka, not yet healed of her bruises, on
reaching Oahu and finding herself in the peaceful haven of Kou, should turn her steps
to the home of that hospitable siren and patroness of the hula Pele-ula, as to a sanitarium
or hospital whose resources would avail for the assuagement of her troubles. It was
almost an article of Pele-ula&#x2019;s creed that in the pleasures and distractions of the
hula was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>to be found a panacea for all the wounds of the spirit; and Pele-ula, as if taking
her cue from the lady of the Venusberg, offered her consolations generously to every
comfort-needing soul that fared her way.
</p>
<p>Hiiaka stepped into the life at Pele-ula&#x2019;s court as if she had been absent from it
for only a day. Madame Pele-ula, good sport that she was, bore no grudge against the
woman who had outplayed her at every turn, and would do it again. She received Hiiaka
with open arms. As to entertainment, the play was the <span class="corr" id="xd29e11203" title="Source: thing thing">thing</span> and that, fortunately, was already appointed for the same evening. It was the same
old performance, the hula kilu, with but slight change in the actors and with full
opportunity for Hiiaka to display her marvelous skill in hurling the kilu.
</p>
<p>It was Hiiaka&#x2019;s play and she, following the custom of the game, was caroling&#x2014;in sober
strain&#x2014;a song of her own; when, to her astonishment, a voice from the crowd struck
in and carried the song to completion in the very words that would have been her&#x2019;s.
Hiiaka stood and listened. The voice had a familiar ring; the song was not yet in
the possession of the public, being known only to a few of her own household, among
whom was to be reckoned Lohiau. There was no avoiding the conclusion: it was Lohiau.
</p>
<p>It remains to tell the miracle of Lohiau&#x2019;s reappearance among men in living form and
at this time. While the body of Lohiau lay entombed in its stony shroud, his restless
spirit fluttered away and sought consolation in the companionship of the song-birds
that ranged the forests of Hawaii.
</p>
<p>When the magician La&#x2019;a, who lived in Kahiki, contemplated the degraded condition of
Lohiau, alienated from all the springs of human affection, living as a wild thing
in the desert, he determined on his rescue and despatched Kolea (plover), one of his
ancestral kupuas, to fetch him. The mission of Kolea was not a success. The voice,
the manner, the arguments of the bird made no appeal to Lohiau; they were, in fact,
distasteful to him and rather increased his devotion to his other bird-friends.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;Well, Kolea, what sort of a place is Kahiki?&#x201d; asked Lohiau.
</p>
<p>&#x201c;A most charming place,&#x201d; he answered, nodding his head and uttering his call, &#x201c;Ko-lé-a,
Ko-lé-a.&#x201d;
</p>
<p>Lohiau was disgusted with his performances and would have nothing more to do with
Kolea.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Kolea returned and reported his failure to La&#x2019;a, that magician sent another bird
on the same errand, one of more seductive ways, Ulili. There was something in the
voice and manner of Ulili that touched the fancy and won the heart of Lohiau at once
and he began to follow him. Ulili skilfully lured him on and at last brought him to
Kahiki and delivered him over to his master. La&#x2019;a ministered to the soul of Lohiau
with such tenderness and skill that he became reconciled once more to human ways.
But the soul of Lohiau still remained an unhoused ghost, and at times ranged afar
in its restless excursions.
</p>
<p>Now it happened that at the very time when these events were taking place Kane-milo-hai,
an elder brother of Pele, was voyaging from Kahiki to Hawaii. His canoe was of that
mystical pattern, the leho (cowry) in which Mawi had sailed. While in the middle of
the Iëië-waho channel he caught sight of the distracted spirit of Lohiau fluttering
like a Mother Carey&#x2019;s chicken over the expanse of waters. The poor ghost, as if desirous
of companionship, drew nigh and presently came so near that Kane-milo-hai captured
it and, having ensconced it in his ipu-holoho-lona,<a class="noteref" id="xd29e11218src" href="#xd29e11218">1</a> he sailed on his way.
</p>
<p>Reaching Hawaii and coming to the desolate scene of Lohiau&#x2019;s tragedy, he recognized
a charred heap as the former bodily residence of the shivering ghost in his keeping.
He broke the stony form into many pieces and then, by the magical power that was his,
out of these fragments he reconstructed the body of Lohiau, imparting to it its original
form and lineaments. Into this body Kane-milo-hai now introduced the soul and Lohiau
lived again.
</p>
<p>The tide of new life surging in the veins of Lohiau stirred in him emotions that found
utterance in song:
</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Having come to himself, Lohiau sought his own. His chancing at Kou and his appearance
at the halau in which Pele-ula was holding her kilu performance, and on the very evening
of Hiiaka&#x2019;s arrival, was an arrangement of converging lines that reflected great credit
on the god of Destiny.
</p>
<p>Lohiau arrived at the kilu hall just in time to witness the opening of the game. Having
seated himself quietly in the outskirts of the assembly, he begged a neighbor to permit
him, as a favor, to conceal himself under the ample width of his kihei, exacting of
him also the promise not to betray his retreat. Thus hidden, he could see without
being seen. The sight of Hiiaka, the words of her song&#x2014;he had heard them a score of
times before&#x2014;stirred within him a thousand memories. Without conscious effort of will,
the words of his response sprang from his heart almost with the spontaneity of an
antiphonal echo. Let us bring together the two cotyledons of this song:
</p>

<p class="first">We must leave to the imagination of the reader the scene that occurred when Lohiau,
the man twice called back from the dead, leaves his hiding place and comes into Hiiaka&#x2019;s
encircling arms lovingly extended to him.
</p>
<p>This was accomplished the reunion of Hiiaka and Lohiau, and thus it came to pass that
these two human streams of characters so different, in defiance of powerful influences
that had long held them apart, were, at length, turned into one channel&#x2014;that of the
man, not wholly earthly, but leavened with the possibility of vast spiritual attainment
under the tonic discipline of affliction; that of the woman, self-reliant, resourceful,
yet acutely in need of affection; human and practical, yet feeling after the divine,
conscious of daily commerce with the skies; and, yet, in spite of all, in bondage
to that universal law which gives to the smaller and weaker body the power to introduce
a perturbation into the orbit of the greater and to pull it away from its proper trajectory.
</p>
<p>The old order has passed away, the order in which the will of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>Pele has ruled almost supreme, regardless of the younger, the human, race which is
fast peopling the land that was hers in the making. Hitherto, surrounded by a cohort
of willing servants ready at all times to sacrifice themselves to her caprice,&#x2014;behold,
a new spirit has leavened the whole mass, a spirit of dissent from the supreme selfishness
of the Vulcan goddess, and the foremost dissident of them all is the obedient little
sister who was first in her devotion to Pele, the warm-hearted girl whom we still
love to call Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele.
